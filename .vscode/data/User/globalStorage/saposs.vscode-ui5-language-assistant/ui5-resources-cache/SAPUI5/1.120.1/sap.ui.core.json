Logging API for JavaScript.\n\nProvides methods to manage a client-side log and to create entries in it. Each of the logging methods {@link jQuery.sap.log.debug}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.info}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.warning}, {@link jQuery.sap.log.error} and {@link jQuery.sap.log.fatal} creates and records a log entry, containing a timestamp, a log level, a message with details and a component info. The log level will be one of {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level} and equals the name of the concrete logging method.\n\nBy using the {@link jQuery.sap.log.setLevel} method, consumers can determine the least important log level which should be recorded. Less important entries will be filtered out. (Note that higher numeric values represent less important levels). The initially set level depends on the mode that UI5 is running in. When the optimized sources are executed, the default level will be {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level.ERROR}. For normal (debug sources), the default level is {@link jQuery.sap.log.Level.DEBUG}.\n\nAll logging methods allow to specify a <b>component</b>. These components are simple strings and don't have a special meaning to the UI5 framework. However they can be used to semantically group log entries that belong to the same software component (or feature). There are two APIs that help to manage logging for such a component. With <code>{@link jQuery.sap.log.getLogger}(sComponent)</code>, one can retrieve a logger that automatically adds the given <code>sComponent</code> as component parameter to each log entry, if no other component is specified. Typically, JavaScript code will retrieve such a logger once during startup and reuse it for the rest of its lifecycle. Second, the {@link jQuery.sap.log.Logger#setLevel}(iLevel, sComponent) method allows to set the log level for a specific component only. This allows a more fine granular control about the created logging entries. {@link jQuery.sap.log.Logger#getLevel} allows to retrieve the currently effective log level for a given component.\n\n{@link jQuery.sap.log.getLogEntries} returns an array of the currently collected log entries.\n\nFurthermore, a listener can be registered to the log. It will be notified whenever a new entry is added to the log. The listener can be used for displaying log entries in a separate page area, or for sending it to some external target (server).","deprecated":{"since":"1.58","text":"use {@link module:sap/base/Log} instead"},"methods":[{"name":"addLogListener","visibility":"public","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"jQuery.sap.log","description":"The global logger"},"parameters":[{"name":"oListener","type":"object","optional":false,"description":"The new listener object that should be informed"}],"description":"Allows to add a new LogListener that will be notified for new log entries.\n\nThe given object must provide method <code>onLogEntry</code> and can also be informed about <code>onDetachFromLog</code> and <code>onAttachToLog</code>"},{"name":"debug","visibility":"public","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"jQuery.sap.log.Logger","description":"The log instance"},"parameters":[{"name":"sMessage","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Message text to display"},{"name":"sDetails","type":"string","optional":true,"defaultValue":"''","description":"Details about the message, might be omitted"},{"name":"sComponent","type":"string","optional":true,"defaultValue":"''","description":"Name of the component that produced the log entry"},{"name":"fnSupportInfo","type":"function","optional":true,"description":"Callback that returns an additional support object to be logged in support mode.

Each of the logging methods {@link module:sap/base/Log.debug}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.info}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.warning}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.error} and {@link module:sap/base/Log.fatal} creates and records a log entry, containing a timestamp, a log level, a message with details and a component info. The log level will be one of {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level} and equals the name of the concrete logging method.\n\nBy using the {@link module:sap/base/Log.setLevel} method, consumers can determine the least important log level which should be recorded. Less important entries will be filtered out. (Note that higher numeric values represent less important levels). The initially set level depends on the mode that UI5 is running in. When the optimized sources are executed, the default level will be {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.ERROR}. For normal (debug sources), the default level is {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.DEBUG}.\n\nAll logging methods allow to specify a <b>component</b>. These components are simple strings and don't have a special meaning to the UI5 framework. However they can be used to semantically group log entries that belong to the same software component (or feature). There are two APIs that help to manage logging for such a component. With {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogger}, one can retrieve a logger that automatically adds the given <code>sComponent</code> as component parameter to each log entry, if no other component is specified. Typically, JavaScript code will retrieve such a logger once during startup and reuse it for the rest of its lifecycle. Second, the {@link module:sap/base/Log.setLevel}(iLevel, sComponent) method allows to set the log level for a specific component only. This allows a more fine grained control about the created logging entries. {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLevel} allows to retrieve the currently effective log level for a given component.\n\n{@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogEntries} returns an array of the currently collected log entries.\n\nFurthermore, a listener can be registered to the log. It will be notified whenever a new entry is added to the log. The listener can be used for displaying log entries in a separate page area, or for sending it to some external target (server).","methods":[{"name":"addLogListener","visibility":"public","static":true,"parameters":[{"name":"oListener","type":"module:sap/base/Log.Listener","optional":false,"description":"The new listener object that should be informed"}],"description":"Allows to add a new listener that will be notified for new log entries.\n\nThe given object must provide method <code>onLogEntry</code> and can also be informed about <code>onDetachFromLog</code>, <code>onAttachToLog</code> and <code>onDiscardLogEntries</code>."},{"name":"debug","visibility":"public","static":true,"parameters":[{"name":"sMessage","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Message text to display"},{"name":"vDetails","type":"string|Error","optional":true,"defaultValue":"''","description":"Optional details about the message, might be omitted.

When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}. The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level <code>sap.ui.define</code> call.\n\nIf the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was given as <code>vFactory</code>, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).\n\n<i>Example:</i><br> The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js', it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'. <pre>\n  sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {\n\n    // create a new class\n    var SomeClass = function() {};\n\n    // add methods to its prototype\n    SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {\n\n        // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )\n        var mSettings = Helper.foo();\n\n        // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')\n        return new Bar(mSettings);\n\n    }\n\n    // return the class as module value\n    return SomeClass;\n\n  });\n</pre>\n\nIn another module or in an application HTML page, the {@link sap.ui.require} API can be used to load the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:\n\n<pre>\nsap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {\n\n  // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it\n  new Something().foo();\n\n});\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Module Name Syntax</h3>\n\n<code>sap.ui.define</code> uses a simplified variant of the {@link jQuery.sap.getResourcePath unified resource name} syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax is, that for <code>sap.ui.define</code> and <code>sap.ui.require</code>, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.\n\nAs a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).\n\nIt is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.\n\n<h3>Dependency to Modules</h3>\n\nIf a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies array.\n\n<b>Note:</b> The order in which the dependency modules are <i>executed</i> is <b>not</b> defined by the order in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies <i>between</i> the dependency modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution order (other than expressed by their dependencies).\n\n<b>Note:</b> A static module export (a literal provided to <code>sap.ui.define</code>) cannot depend on the module exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function, potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.\n\n<h3>Asynchronous Contract</h3>\n\n<code>sap.ui.define</code> is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific test scenario.\n\nFor example, callers of <code>sap.ui.define</code> must not use the module export value immediately after invoking <code>sap.ui.define</code>:\n\n<pre>\n  // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT\n\n  // define a class Something as AMD module\n  sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {\n    var Something = function() {};\n    return Something;\n  });\n\n  // DON'T DO THAT!\n  // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called\n  new Something();\n\n</pre>\n\nApplications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies <b>MUST</b> use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.\n\n<h3>(No) Global References</h3>\n\nTo be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with <code>sap.ui.define</code> should not make any use of global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.\n\nAs the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel to the old global names. The fourth parameter of <code>sap.ui.define</code> has been added to support that transition phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features\n\n<ol> <li>Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current module is ensured</li> <li>The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under the global name which is derived from the ID of the module</li> </ol>\n\nThe parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.\n\n<h3>Third Party Modules</h3> Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies in a <code>sap.ui.define</code> call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports available, so called <em>shims</em> have to be defined.\n\nNote that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.\n\nFor third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace <code>sap/ui/thirdparty/</code>), the necessary shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module <code>ui5loader-autoconfig.js</code> during bootstrap.\n\nExample: <pre>\n  // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'\n  // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'\n  // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value\n  // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js\n  sap.ui.loader.config({\n    shim: {\n      'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {\n         amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders\n         exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value\n      }\n    }\n  });\n\n  // now the module can be retrieved like other modules\n  sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {\n\n    new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)\n\n    ...\n  });\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Differences to Standard AMD</h3>\n\nThe current implementation of <code>sap.ui.define</code> differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api) or from concrete AMD loaders like <code>requireJS</code> in several aspects: <ul> <li>The name <code>sap.ui.define</code> is different from the plain <code>define</code>. This has two reasons: first, it avoids the impression that <code>sap.ui.define</code> is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and <code>sap.ui.define</code> in one application as long as UI5 or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect methods <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax, can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them using the <code>amd:true</code> flag (see example above)</li> <li>Depending on configuration and the current context, <code>sap.ui.define</code> loads the dependencies of a module either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out.

They can store a single value of a simple data type (like 'string' or 'int'). They have a <i>name</i> (e.g. 'size') and methods to get the current value (<code>getSize</code>), or to set a new value (<code>setSize</code>). When a property is modified by calling the setter, the ManagedObject is marked as invalidated. A managed property can be bound against a property in a {@link sap.ui.model.Model} by using the {@link #bindProperty} method. Updates to the model property will be automatically reflected in the managed property and - if TwoWay databinding is active, changes to the managed property will be reflected in the model. An existing binding can be removed by calling {@link #unbindProperty}.\n\nIf a ManagedObject is cloned, the clone will have the same values for its managed properties as the source of the clone - if the property wasn't bound. If it is bound, the property in the clone will be bound to the same model property as in the source.\n\nDetails about the declaration of a managed property, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend } method.\n\n<h3>Aggregations</h3> Managed aggregations can store one or more references to other ManagedObjects. They are a mean to control the lifecycle of the aggregated objects: one ManagedObject can be aggregated by at most one parent ManagedObject at any time. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, all aggregated objects are destroyed as well and the object itself is removed from its parent. That is, aggregations won't contain destroyed objects or null/undefined.\n\nAggregations have a <i>name</i> ('e.g 'header' or 'items'), a <i>cardinality</i> ('0..1' or '0..n') and are of a specific <i>type</i> (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the aggregated object for a specific aggregation of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. <code>setHeader</code>, <code>getHeader</code> for an aggregation named 'header'). For an aggregation of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all aggregated objects (<code>getItems</code>), to locate an object in the aggregation (e.g. <code>indexOfItem</code>), to add, insert or remove a single aggregated object (<code>addItem</code>, <code>insertItem</code>, <code>removeItem</code>) or to remove or destroy all objects from an aggregation (<code>removeAllItems</code>, <code>destroyItems</code>).\n\nDetails about the declaration of a managed aggregation, the metadata that describes the aggregation, and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.\n\nAggregations of cardinality 0..n can be bound to a collection in a model by using {@link #bindAggregation} (and unbound again using {@link #unbindAggregation}). For each context in the model collection, a corresponding object will be created in the managed aggregation, either by cloning a template object or by calling a factory function.\n\nAggregations also control the databinding context of bound objects: by default, aggregated objects inherit all models and binding contexts from their parent object.\n\nWhen a ManagedObject is cloned, all aggregated objects will be cloned as well - but only if they haven't been added by databinding. In that case, the aggregation in the clone will be bound to the same model collection.\n\n<h3>Associations</h3> Managed associations also form a relationship between objects, but they don't define a lifecycle for the associated objects. They even can 'break' in the sense that an associated object might have been destroyed already although it is still referenced in an association. For the same reason, the internal storage for associations are not direct object references but only the IDs of the associated target objects.\n\nAssociations have a <i>name</i> ('e.g 'initialFocus'), a <i>cardinality</i> ('0..1' or '0..n') and are of a specific <i>type</i> (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the associated object for a specific association of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. <code>setInitialFocus</code>, <code>getInitialFocus</code>). For an association of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all associated objects (<code>getRefItems</code>), to add, insert or remove a single associated object (<code>addRefItem</code>, <code>insertRefItem</code>, <code>removeRefItem</code>) or to remove all objects from an association (<code>removeAllRefItems</code>).\n\nDetails about the declaration of a managed association, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.\n\nAssociations can't be bound to the model.\n\nWhen a ManagedObject is cloned, the result for an association depends on the relationship between the associated target object and the root of the clone operation. If the associated object is part of the to-be-cloned object tree (reachable via aggregations from the root of the clone operation), then the cloned association will reference the clone of the associated object. Otherwise the association will reference the same object as in the original tree. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, other objects that are only associated, are not affected by the destroy operation.\n\n<h3>Events</h3> Managed events provide a mean for communicating important state changes to an arbitrary number of 'interested' listeners. Events have a <i>name</i> and (optionally) a set of <i>parameters</i>. For each event there will be methods to add or remove an event listener as well as a method to fire the event. (e.g. <code>attachChange</code>, <code>detachChange</code>, <code>fireChange</code> for an event named 'change').\n\nDetails about the declaration of managed events, the metadata that describes the event, and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.\n\nWhen a ManagedObject is cloned, all listeners registered for any event in the clone source are also registered to the clone. Later changes are not reflected in any direction (neither from source to clone, nor vice versa).\n\n<a name=\"lowlevelapi\"><h3>Low Level APIs:</h3></a> The prototype of ManagedObject provides several generic, low level APIs to manage properties, aggregations, associations, and events. These generic methods are solely intended for implementing higher level, non-generic methods that manage a single managed property etc. (e.g. a function <code>setSize(value)</code> that sets a new value for property 'size'). {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend} creates default implementations of those higher level APIs for all managed aspects. The implementation of a subclass then can override those default implementations with a more specific implementation, e.g. to implement a side effect when a specific property is set or retrieved. It is therefore important to understand that the generic low-level methods ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR GENERIC ACCESS to the state of a managed object, as that would bypass the overriding higher level methods and their side effects.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"object","metadataClass":"sap.ui.base.ManagedObjectMetadata","specialSettings":[{"name":"id","type":"sap.ui.core.ID","visibility":"public","description":"Unique ID of this instance.

Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this name usually is the plural name, whereas it is the singular name in case of 0..1 relations.\n\nThe possible values for a setting depend on its kind: <ul> <li>for simple properties, the value has to match the documented type of the property (no type conversion occurs)</li> <li>for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated type, or an object literal from which, the default class of the aggregation (or the corresponding aggregation type as fallback) will be instantiated.</li> <li>for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type, a single instance or an object literal from which the default class will be instantiated.</li> <li>for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted</li> <li>for 0..n associations, an array of instances of the associated type or of IDs is accepted</li> <li>for events, either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of length 3, where the first element is an arbitrary payload object, the second one is a function and the 3rd one is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of arrays where each nested array has the 2 or 3 element structure described before (multiple listeners).</li> </ul>\n\nEach subclass should document the name and type of its supported settings in its constructor documentation.\n\nExample usage: <pre>\nnew Dialog({\n   title: \"Some title text\",            // property of type \"string\"\n   showHeader: true,                    // property of type \"boolean\"\n   endButton: new Button(...),          // 0..1 aggregation\n   content: [                           // 0..n aggregation\n      new Input(...),\n      new Input(...)\n   ],\n   afterClose: function(oEvent) { ... } // event handler function\n});\n</pre>\n\nInstead of static values and object instances, data binding expressions can be used, either embedded in a string or as a binding info object as described in {@link #bindProperty} or {@link #bindAggregation}.\n\nExample usage: <pre>\nnew Dialog({\n   title: \"{/title}\",       // embedded binding expression, points to a string property in the data model\n   ...\n   content: {               // binding info object\n      path : \"/inputItems\", // points to a collection in the data model\n      template : new Input(...)\n   }\n});\n</pre>\n\nNote that when setting string values, any curly braces in those values need to be escaped, so they are not interpreted as binding expressions. Use {@link #escapeSettingsValue} to do so.\n\n<b>Note:</b> As of version 1.120, providing aggregation content via an object literal is deprecated, in case the object's type is given via the property 'Type' as a string, or is derived via the defined type of the aggregation. Additionally, as of version 1.120, a ManagedObject subclass can specify a <code>defaultClass</code>, e.g. for cases where only a single class is valid. Please refer to the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.MetadataOptions.Aggregation Aggregation} documentation for more details on the <code>defaultClass</code>.\n\nBesides the settings documented below, ManagedObject itself supports the following special settings: <ul> <li><code>id : <i>sap.ui.core.ID</i></code> an ID for the new instance. Some subclasses (Element, Component) require the id to be unique in a specific scope (e.g. an Element Id must be unique across all Elements, a Component id must be unique across all Components). <li><code>models : <i>object</i></code> a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Model} instances keyed by their model name (alias). Each entry with key <i>k</i> in this object has the same effect as a call <code>this.setModel(models[k], k);</code>.</li> <li><code>bindingContexts : <i>object</i></code> a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Context} instances keyed by their model name. Each entry with key <i>k</i> in this object has the same effect as a call <code>this.setBindingContext(bindingContexts[k], k);</code></li> <li><code>objectBindings : <i>object</i></code> a map of binding paths keyed by the corresponding model name. Each entry with key <i>k</i> in this object has the same effect as a call <code>this.bindObject(objectBindings[k], k);</code></li> <li><code>metadataContexts : <i>object</i></code> an array of single binding contexts keyed by the corresponding model or context name. The purpose of the <code>metadataContexts</code> special setting is to deduce as much information as possible from the binding context of the control in order to be able to predefine certain standard properties like e.g. <i>visible, enabled, tooltip,...</i>\n\nThe structure is an array of single contexts, where a single context is a map containing the following keys: <ul> <li><code>path: <i>string (mandatory)</i></code> The path to the corresponding model property or object, e.g. '/Customers/Name'. A path can also be relative, e.g. 'Name'</li> <li><code>model: <i>string (optional)</i></code> The name of the model, in case there is no name then the undefined model is taken</li> <li><code>name: <i>string (optional)</i></code> A name for the context to used in templating phase</li> <li><code>kind: <i>string (optional)</i></code> The kind of the adapter, either <code>field</code> for single properties or <code>object</code> for structured contexts. <li><code>adapter: <i>string (optional)</i></code> The path to an interpretion class that dilivers control relevant data depending on the context, e.g. enabled, visible. If not supplied the OData meta data is interpreted.</li> </ul> The syntax for providing the <code>metadataContexts</code> is as follows: <code>{SINGLE_CONTEXT1},...,{SINGLE_CONTEXTn}</code> or for simplicity in case there is only one context <code>{SINGLE_CONTEXT}</code>.\n\nExamples for such metadataContexts are: <ul> <li><code>{/Customers/Name}</code> a single part with an absolute path to the property <i>Name</i> of the <i>Customers</i> entity set in the default model</li> <li><code>{path: 'Customers/Name', model:'json'}</code> a single part with an absolute path to the property <i>Name</i> of the <i>Customers</i> entity set in a named model</li> <li><code>{parts: [{path: 'Customers/Name'},{path: 'editable', model: 'viewModel'}]}</code> a combination of single binding contexts, one context from the default model and one from the viewModel</li> </ul></li> </ul>"},"properties":[{"name":"create","visibility":"public","static":true,"type":"undefined","description":"Creates a new ManagedObject from the given data.\n\nIf <code>vData</code> is a managed object already, that object is returned.

The <code>formatter</code> function or a {@link sap.ui.model.CompositeType composite type} then can be used to combine the parts, Properties with a composite binding are also known as \"calculated fields\".\n\nExample: <pre>\n  oTxt.bindValue({\n    parts: [\n      {path: \"/firstName\", type: \"sap.ui.model.type.String\"},\n      {path: \"myModel2>/lastName\"}\n    ]\n  });\n</pre>\n\nNote that a composite binding will be forced into mode <code>OneWay</code> when one of the binding parts is not in mode <code>TwoWay</code>.\n\n<b>Static Binding</b><br> A StaticBinding allows to define static values within a <code>sap.ui.model.CompositeBinding</code>. It behaves like a property binding but always returns the value that is stored in the binding itself. The binding does not have a <code>sap.ui.model.Context</code>, a <code>sap.ui.model.Model</code> or a <code>oBindingInfo.path</code>. A StaticBinding is created when a <code>oBindingInfo.value</code> is passed instead of a <code>oBindingInfo.path</code> or <code>oBindingInfo.parts[i].path</code>.\n\nAlso see {@link sap.ui.model.StaticBinding StaticBinding} in the documentation.\n\n<b>Formatter Functions</b><br> When a formatter function is specified for the binding or for a binding part, it will be called with the value of the bound model property. After setting the initial property value, the formatter function will only be called again when the bound model property changes (simple property binding) or when at least one of the bound model properties changes (formatter function of a composite binding). Note that a binding only monitors the bound model data for changes. Dependencies of the formatter implementation to other model data is not known to the binding and changes won't be detected.\n\nWhen the formatter for a property binding (simple or composite) is called, the managed object will be given as <code>this</code> context. For formatters of binding parts in a composite binding, this is not the case.\n\nAlso see {@link topic:91f0652b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070 Property Binding} in the documentation."},{"name":"clone","visibility":"public","returnValue":{"type":"this","description":"Reference to the newly created clone"},"parameters":[{"name":"sIdSuffix","type":"string","optional":true,"description":"a suffix to be appended to the cloned object ID"},{"name":"aLocalIds","type":"string[]","optional":true,"description":"an array of local IDs within the cloned hierarchy (internally used)"},{"name":"oOptions","type":"Object","optional":true,"defaultValue":"'\\{cloneChildren:true, cloneBindings:true\\}'","parameterProperties":{"cloneChildren":{"name":"cloneChildren","type":"boolean","optional":true,"defaultValue":false,"description":"Whether associations and aggregations will be cloned"},"cloneBindings":{"name":"cloneBindings","type":"boolean","optional":true,"defaultValue":false,"description":"Whether bindings will be cloned"}},"description":"Configuration object; when omitted, both properties default to <code>true</code>; when specified, undefined properties default to <code>false</code>"}],"description":"Clones a tree of objects starting with the object on which clone is called first (root object).\n\nThe IDs within the newly created clone tree are derived from the original IDs by appending the given <code>sIdSuffix</code> (if no suffix is given, one will be created; it will be unique across multiple clone calls).\n\nThe <code>oOptions</code> configuration object can have the following properties: <ul> <li>The boolean value <code>cloneChildren</code> specifies whether associations/aggregations will be cloned</li> <li>The boolean value <code>cloneBindings</code> specifies if bindings will be cloned</li> </ul> Note: In case the configuration <code>oOptions</code> is specified, the default values <code>true</code> no longer apply, which means in case <code>cloneChildren</code> or <code>cloneBindings</code> is not specified, then this ia assumed to be <code>false</code> and associations/aggregations or bindings are not cloned.\n\nFor each cloned object, the following settings are cloned based on the metadata of the object and the defined options: <ul> <li>All properties that are not bound. If <code>cloneBindings</code> is <code>false</code>, also the bound properties will be cloned; in general, values are referenced 1:1, not cloned.

As a result, any side effects of mutator methods (<code>setProperty</code> etc.) or init hooks are repeated during clone creation.

Before evaluating the selector in the context of an element or control, all occurrences of the placeholder have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that element or control.

The single parameter <code>oLibInfo</code> is an info object that describes the content of the library.\n\nWhen the <code>oLibInfo</code> has been processed, a normalized version of it will be kept and will be returned as library information in later calls to {@link #getLoadedLibraries}. Finally, <code>initLibrary</code> fires (the currently private) {@link #event:LibraryChanged} event with operation 'add' for the newly loaded library.\n\n<h3>Side Effects</h3>\n\nWhile analyzing the <code>oLibInfo</code>, the framework takes some additional actions:\n\n<ul> <li>If the info object contains a list of <code>interfaces</code>, they will be registered with the {@link sap.ui.base.DataType} class to make them available as aggregation types in managed objects.</li>\n\n<li>If the object contains a list of <code>controls</code> or <code>elements</code>, {@link sap.ui.lazyRequire lazy stubs} will be created for their constructor as well as for their static <code>extend</code> and <code>getMetadata</code> methods.<br> <b>Note:</b> Future versions might abandon the concept of lazy stubs as it requires synchronous XMLHttpRequests which have been deprecated (see {@link http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org}). To be on the safe side, productive applications should always require any modules that they directly depend on.</li>\n\n<li>With the <code>noLibraryCSS</code> property, the library can be marked as 'theming-free'. Otherwise, the framework will add a &lt;link&gt; tag to the page's head, pointing to the library's theme-specific stylesheet. The creation of such a &lt;link&gt; tag can be suppressed with the {@link sap.ui.core.Configuration global configuration option} <code>preloadLibCss</code>. It can contain a list of library names for which no stylesheet should be included. This is e.g. useful when an application merges the CSS for multiple libraries and already loaded the resulting stylesheet.</li>\n\n<li>If a list of library <code>dependencies</code> is specified in the info object, those libraries will be loaded synchronously by <code>initLibrary</code>.<br> <b>Note:</b> Dependencies between libraries don't have to be modeled as AMD dependencies. Only when enums or types from an additional library are used in the coding of the <code>library.js</code> module, the library should be additionally listed in the AMD dependencies.</li> </ul>\n\nLast but not least, higher layer frameworks might want to include their own metadata for libraries. The property <code>extensions</code> might contain such additional metadata. Its structure is not defined by the framework, but it is strongly suggested that each extension only occupies a single property in the <code>extensions</code> object and that the name of that property contains some namespace information (e.g. library name that introduces the feature) to avoid conflicts with other extensions. The framework won't touch the content of <code>extensions</code> but will make it available in the library info objects returned by {@link #getLoadedLibraries}.\n\n<h3>Relationship to Descriptor for Libraries (manifest.json)</h3>\n\nThe information contained in <code>oLibInfo</code> is partially redundant to the content of the descriptor for the same library (its <code>manifest.json</code> file). Future versions of UI5 might ignore the information provided in <code>oLibInfo</code> and might evaluate the descriptor file instead.

By default, the bundle will be loaded synchronously (for compatibility reasons). Only when the optional parameter <code>vUrl</code> is given as <code>true</code> or as a configuration object with a property of <code>async:true</code>, then the bundle will be loaded asynchronously and a <code>Promise</code> will be returned (preferred usage).\n\nAfter preloading the bundle, dependency information from the bundle is evaluated and any missing libraries are also preloaded.\n\nOnly then the library entry module (named <code><i>your/lib</i>/library.js</code>) will be required and executed. The module is supposed to call <code>sap.ui.getCore().initLibrary(...)</code> providing the framework with additional metadata about the library, e.g. its version, the set of contained enums, types, interfaces, controls and elements and whether the library requires CSS. If the library requires CSS, a &lt;link&gt; will be added to the page referring to the corresponding <code>library.css</code> stylesheet for the library and the current theme.\n\nWhen the optional parameter <code>vUrl</code> is given as a string or when a configuration object is given with a non-empty, string-valued property <code>url</code>, then that URL will be registered for the namespace of the library and all resources will be loaded from that location. This is convenience for a call like <pre>\n  sap.ui.loader.config({\n    paths: {\n      \"lib/with/slashes\": vUrl\n    }\n  });\n</pre>\n\nWhen the given library has been loaded already, no further action will be taken, especially, a given URL will not be registered! In the case of asynchronous loading, a Promise will be returned, but will be resolved immediately.\n\n<h3>When to use</h3>\n\nFor applications that follow the best practices and use components with component descriptors (manifest.json), the framework will load all declared mandatory libraries and their dependencies automatically before instantiating the application component.\n\nThe same is true for libraries that are listed in the bootstrap configuration (e.g. with the attribute <code>data-sap-ui-libs</code>). They will be loaded before the <code>init</code> event of the UI5 Core is fired.\n\nOnly when an app declares a library to be a lazy library dependency or when code does not use descriptors at all, then an explicit call to <code>loadLibrary</code> becomes necessary. The call should be made before artifacts (controls, elements, types, helpers, modules etc.) from the library are used or required. This allows the framework to optimize access to those artifacts.\n\nFor example, when an app uses a heavy-weight charting library that shouldn't be loaded during startup, it can declare it as \"lazy\" and load it just before it loads and displays a view that uses the charting library: <pre>\n  sap.ui.getCore().loadLibrary(\"heavy.charting\", {async: true})\n    .then(function() {\n      View.create({\n        name: \"myapp.views.HeavyChartingView\",\n        type: ViewType.XML\n      });\n    });\n</pre>","deprecated":{"since":"1.119","text":"Please use {@link sap.ui.core.Lib.load Lib.load} instead."}},{"name":"lock","visibility":"public","description":"Locks the Core.

This means that controls rendering a list of items can attach this delegate to get a common keyboard and mouse support to navigate between these items. It is possible to navigate between the items via the arrow keys. If needed, paging using the Page Up and Page Down keys is possible. (To activate call <code>setPageSize</code> with a value &gt; 0.) HOME and END keys are also supported. Focusing an item via mouse also is also supported. For mouse navigation, the <code>mousedown</code> event is used.\n\nAs the <code>ItemNavigation</code> works with DOM nodes, the items and the control area must be provided as DOM references. There is one root DOM reference (set via <code>setRootDomRef</code>). All item DOM references (set via <code>setItemDomRefs</code>) must be places somewhere inside of this root DOM reference. Only focusable items are used for the navigation, meaning disabled items or separator items are just ignored by navigating through the items. In some cases however, it makes sense to put the non-focusable items in the array of the DOM references to keep the indexes stable or like in the calling control. <b>Hint:</b> To make a DOM reference focusable a <code>tabindex</code> of -1 can be set.\n\n<b>Note</b> After re-rendering of the control or changing the DOM nodes of the control, the DOM references of the <code>ItemNavigation</code> must be updated. Then the same item (corresponding to the index) will get the focus.\n\nThe <code>ItemNavigation</code> adjusts the <code>tabindex</code> of all DOM references relating to the current focused item. So if the control containing the items gets the focus (e.g. via tab navigation), it is always the focused items which will be focused.\n\n<b>Note:</b> If the <code>ItemNavigation</code> is nested in another <code>ItemNavigation</code> (e.g. <code>SegmentedButton</code> in <code>Toolbar</code>), the <code>RootDomRef</code> will always have <code>tabindex</code> -1.\n\nPer default the <code>ItemNavigation</code> cycles over the items. It navigates again to the first item if the Arrow Down or Arrow Right key is pressed while the last item has the focus. It navigates to the last item if arrow up or arrow left is pressed while the first item has the focus. If you want to stop the navigation at the first and last item, call the <code>setCycling</code> method with a value of <code>false</code>.\n\nIt is possible to have multiple columns in the item navigation. If multiple columns are used, the keyboard navigation changes. The Arrow Right and Arrow Left keys will take the user to the next or previous item, and the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys will navigate the same way but in a vertical direction.\n\nThe <code>ItemNavigation</code> also allows setting a selected index that is used to identify the selected item. Initially, if no other focus is set, the selected item will be the focused one. Note that navigating through the items will not change the selected item, only the focus. (For example a radio group has one selected item.)","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"object"},"constructor":{"visibility":"public","parameters":[{"name":"oDomRef","type":"Element","optional":false,"description":"The root DOM reference that includes all items"},{"name":"aItemDomRefs","type":"Element[]","optional":false,"description":"Array of DOM references representing the items for the navigation"},{"name":"bNotInTabChain","type":"boolean","optional":true,"defaultValue":false,"description":"Whether the selected element should be in the tab chain or not"}],"description":"Creates an <code>ItemNavigation</code> delegate that can be attached to controls requiring capabilities for keyboard navigation between items."},"events":[{"name":"AfterFocus","visibility":"public","parameters":[{"name":"index","type":"int","description":"Index of the item"},{"name":"event","type":"jQuery.Event","description":"Event that leads to the focus change"}],"description":"The <code>AfterFocus</code> event is fired after the actual item is focused.

If an <code>Element</code> has been rendered, its related DOM gets the same ID as the <code>Element</code> and thereby can be retrieved via API. When the state of an <code>Element</code> changes, it informs its parent <code>Control</code> which usually re-renders then.\n\n<h3>Dispatching Events</h3>\n\nThe UI5 framework already registers generic listeners for common browser events, such as <code>click</code> or <code>keydown</code>. When called, the generic listener first determines the corresponding target element using {@link jQuery#control}. Then it checks whether the element has an event handler method for the event. An event handler method by convention has the same name as the event, but prefixed with \"on\": Method <code>onclick</code> is the handler for the <code>click</code> event, method <code>onkeydown</code> the handler for the <code>keydown</code> event and so on. If there is such a method, it will be called with the original event as the only parameter. If the element has a list of delegates registered, their handler functions will be called the same way, where present. The set of implemented handlers might differ between element and delegates. Not each handler implemented by an element has to be implemented by its delegates, and delegates can implement handlers that the corresponding element doesn't implement.\n\nA list of browser events that are handled that way can be found in {@link module:sap/ui/events/ControlEvents}. Additionally, the framework dispatches pseudo events ({@link module:sap/ui/events/PseudoEvents}) using the same naming convention. Last but not least, some framework events are also dispatched that way, e.g. <code>BeforeRendering</code>, <code>AfterRendering</code> (only for controls) and <code>ThemeChanged</code>.\n\nIf further browser events are needed, controls can register listeners on the DOM using native APIs in their <code>onAfterRendering</code> handler. If needed, they can do this for their aggregated elements as well. If events might fire often (e.g. <code>mousemove</code>), it is best practice to register them only while needed, and deregister afterwards. Anyhow, any registered listeners must be cleaned up in the <code>onBeforeRendering</code> listener and before destruction in the <code>exit</code> hook.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"element","metadataClass":"sap.ui.core.ElementMetadata","aggregations":[{"name":"tooltip","singularName":"tooltip","type":"sap.ui.core.TooltipBase","altTypes":["string"],"cardinality":"0..1","visibility":"public","description":"The tooltip that should be shown for this Element.\n\nIn the most simple case, a tooltip is a string that will be rendered by the control and displayed by the browser when the mouse pointer hovers over the control's DOM.

Exceptions will be documented for the corresponding controls (e.g. <code>sap.ui.core.HTML</code> does not support tooltips).\n\nAlternatively, <code>tooltip</code> can act like a 0..1 aggregation and can be set to a tooltip control (an instance of a subclass of <code>sap.ui.core.TooltipBase</code>). In that case, the framework will take care of rendering the tooltip control in a popup-like manner. Such a tooltip control can display arbitrary content, not only a string.\n\nUI5 currently does not provide a recommended implementation of <code>TooltipBase</code> as the use of content-rich tooltips is discouraged by the Fiori Design Guidelines.

See the section \"Handling of Events\" in the {@link #constructor} documentation to learn how events will be dispatched and how event handler methods have to be named to be found.\n\nIf multiple delegates are registered for the same element, they will be called in the order of their registration. Double registrations are prevented. Before a delegate is added, all registrations of the same delegate (no matter what value for <code>oThis</code> was used for their registration) are removed and only then the delegate is added. Note that this might change the position of the delegate in the list of delegates.\n\nWhen an element is cloned, all its event delegates will be added to the clone. This behavior is well-suited for applications which want to add delegates that also work with templates in aggregation bindings. For control development, the internal <code>addDelegate</code> method may be more suitable. Delegates added via that method are not cloned automatically, as typically each control instance takes care of adding its own delegates.\n\n<strong>Important:</strong> If event delegates were added, the delegate will still be called even if the event was processed and/or cancelled via <code>preventDefault</code> by the Element or another event delegate. <code>preventDefault</code> only prevents the event from bubbling. It should be checked e.g. in the event delegate's listener whether an Element is still enabled via <code>getEnabled</code>. Additionally there might be other things that delegates need to check depending on the event (e.g. not adding a key twice to an output string etc.).\n\nSee {@link topic:bdf3e9818cd84d37a18ee5680e97e1c1 Event Handler Methods} for a general explanation of event handling in controls.\n\n<b>Note:</b> Setting the special <code>canSkipRendering</code> property to <code>true</code> for the event delegate object itself lets the framework know that the <code>onBeforeRendering</code> and <code>onAfterRendering</code> event handlers of the delegate are compatible with the contract of {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager Renderer.apiVersion 4}.

The single parameter <code>mSettings</code> is an info object that describes the content of the library.\n\nWhen the <code>mSettings</code> has been processed, a normalized version will be set on the library instance Finally, this function fires {@link #event:LibraryChanged} event with operation 'add' for the newly loaded library.\n\n<h3>Side Effects</h3>\n\nWhile analyzing the <code>mSettings</code>, the framework takes some additional actions:\n\n<ul> <li>If the object contains a list of <code>interfaces</code>, they will be registered with the {@link sap.ui.base.DataType} class to make them available as aggregation types in managed objects.</li>\n\n<li>If the object contains a list of <code>controls</code> or <code>elements</code>, {@link sap.ui.lazyRequire lazy stubs} will be created for their constructor as well as for their static <code>extend</code> and <code>getMetadata</code> methods.\n\n<b>Note:</b> Future versions of UI5 will abandon the concept of lazy stubs as it requires synchronous XMLHttpRequests which have been deprecated (see {@link http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org}). To be on the safe side, productive applications should always require any modules that they directly depend on.</li>\n\n<li>With the <code>noLibraryCSS</code> property, the library can be marked as 'theming-free'. Otherwise, the framework will add a &lt;link&gt; tag to the page's head, pointing to the library's theme-specific stylesheet. The creation of such a &lt;link&gt; tag can be suppressed with the {@link sap.ui.core.Configuration global configuration option} <code>preloadLibCss</code>. It can contain a list of library names for which no stylesheet should be included. This is e.g. useful when an application merges the CSS for multiple libraries and already loaded the resulting stylesheet.</li>\n\n<li>If a list of library <code>dependencies</code> is specified in the info object, those libraries will be loaded synchronously if they haven't been loaded yet.\n\n<b>Note:</b> Dependencies between libraries have to be modeled consistently in several places: <ul> <li>Both eager and lazy dependencies have to be modelled in the <code>.library</code> file.</li> <li>By default, UI5 Tooling generates a <code>manifest.json</code> file from the content of the <code>.library</code> file. However, if the <code>manifest.json</code> file for the library is not generated but maintained manually, it must be kept consistent with the <code>.library</code> file, especially regarding its listed library dependencies.</li> <li>All eager library dependencies must be declared as AMD dependencies of the <code>library.js</code> module by referring to the corresponding <code>\"some/lib/namespace/library\"</code> module of each library dependency.</code></li> <li>All eager dependencies must be listed in the <code>dependencies</code> property of the info object.</li> <li>All lazy dependencies <b>must not</b> be listed as AMD dependencies or in the <code>dependencies</code> property of the info object.</li> </ul>\n\nLast but not least, higher layer frameworks might want to include their own metadata for libraries. The property <code>extensions</code> might contain such additional metadata. Its structure is not defined by the framework, but it is strongly suggested that each extension only occupies a single property in the <code>extensions</code> object and that the name of that property contains some namespace information (e.g. library name that introduces the feature) to avoid conflicts with other extensions. The framework won't touch the content of <code>extensions</code> but will make it available in the library info objects provided by {@link #.load}.\n\n<h3>Relationship to Descriptor for Libraries (manifest.json)</h3>\n\nThe information contained in <code>mSettings</code> is partially redundant to the content of the descriptor for the same library (its <code>manifest.json</code> file). Future versions of UI5 will ignore the information provided in <code>mSettings</code> and will evaluate the descriptor file instead. Library developers therefore must keep the information in both files in sync if the <code>manifest.json</code> file is maintained manually."},{"name":"isDepCacheEnabled","visibility":"restricted","allowedFor":["sap.ui.core"],"static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"boolean","description":"whether dep-cache info files should be loaded"},"description":"Whether dependency cache info files should be loaded instead of preload files."},{"name":"isLoaded","visibility":"public","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"boolean","description":"Returns <code>true</code> if the library is loaded.

The module is supposed to call {@link #.init} providing the framework with additional metadata about the library, e.g. its version, the set of contained enums, types, interfaces, controls and elements and whether the library requires CSS. If the library requires CSS, a &lt;link&gt; will be added to the page referring to the corresponding <code>library.css</code> stylesheet for the library and the current theme.\n\nWhen the optional parameter <code>mOptions.url</code> is given, then that URL will be registered for the namespace of the library and all resources will be loaded from that location. This is convenience for a call like <pre>\n  sap.ui.loader.config({\n    paths: {\n      \"lib/with/slashes\": mOptions.url\n    }\n  });\n</pre>\n\nWhen the given library has been loaded already, no further action will be taken, especially, a given URL will not be registered. A Promise will be returned, but will be resolved immediately.\n\n<h3>When to use</h3>\n\nFor applications that follow the best practices and use components with component descriptors (manifest.json), the framework will load all declared mandatory libraries and their dependencies automatically before instantiating the application component.\n\nThe same is true for libraries that are listed in the bootstrap configuration (e.g. with the attribute <code>data-sap-ui-libs</code>). They will be loaded before the <code>init</code> event of the UI5 Core is fired.\n\nOnly when an app declares a library to be a lazy library dependency or when code does not use descriptors at all, then an explicit call to <code>loadLibrary</code> becomes necessary. The call should be made before artifacts (controls, elements, types, helpers, modules etc.) from the library are used or required. This allows the framework to optimize access to those artifacts.\n\nFor example, when an app uses a heavy-weight charting library that shouldn't be loaded during startup, it can declare it as \"lazy\" and load it just before it loads and displays a view that uses the charting library: <pre>\n  await Library.load({name: \"heavy.charting\"});\n  await View.create({\n      name: \"myapp.views.HeavyChartingView\",\n      type: ViewType.XML\n  });\n</pre>"}]},{"kind":"typedef","name":"sap.ui.core.LibraryInfo","basename":"LibraryInfo","resource":"sap/ui/core/Core.js","module":"sap/ui/core/Core","static":true,"visibility":"public","description":"Info object for the library","properties":[{"name":"version","type":"string","optional":false,"visibility":"public","description":"Version of the library"},{"name":"name","type":"string","optional":true,"visibility":"public","description":"Name of the library; when given it must match the name by which the library has been loaded"},{"name":"dependencies","type":"string[]","optional":true,"visibility":"public","description":"List of libraries that this library depends on; names are in dot notation (e.g. \"sap.ui.core\")"},{"name":"types","type":"string[]","optional":true,"visibility":"public","description":"List of names of types that this library provides; names are in dot notation (e.g. \"sap.ui.core.CSSSize\")"},{"name":"interfaces","type":"string[]","optional":true,"visibility":"public","description":"List of names of interface types that this library provides; names are in dot notation (e.g. \"sap.ui.core.PopupInterface\")"},{"name":"controls","type":"string[]","optional":true,"visibility":"public","description":"Names of control types that this library provides; names are in dot notation (e.g. \"sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer\")"},{"name":"elements","type":"string[]","optional":true,"visibility":"public","description":"Names of element types that this library provides (excluding controls); names are in dot notation (e.g. \"sap.ui.core.Item\")"},{"name":"noLibraryCSS","type":"boolean","optional":true,"visibility":"public","description":"Indicates whether the library doesn't provide/use theming.

See {@link topic:e6bb33d076dc4f23be50c082c271b9f0 Typed Views} for further information.\n\n<b>Example:</b> Defining a typed view (module 'myapp/views/MainView.js') <pre>\n  // view definition\n  sap.ui.define([\n    \"sap/ui/core/mvc/View\",\n    \"sap/m/Panel\"\n  ], function(View, Panel) {\n\n    return View.extend(\"myapp.views.MainView\", {\n\n      // define, which controller to use\n      getControllerName: function() {\n        return \"myapp.controller.Main\";\n      },\n\n      // whether the ID of content controls should be prefixed automatically with the view's ID\n      getAutoPrefixId: function() {\n        return true; // default is false\n      }\n\n      // create view content and return the root control(s)\n      // or a Promise resolving with the control(s).\n      createContent: function() {\n        return new Promise(function(res, rej) {\n            res(new Panel({...}));\n        }).catch(function(err) {\n            rej(err);\n        });\n      }\n    });\n  });\n</pre>\n\n<h3>View Instantiation</h3> The preferred way of instantiating a typed view is via the generic factory {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View.create View.create}.\n\nWhen the <code>viewName</code> starts with prefix <code>\"module:\"</code>, the remainder of the name is assumed to be the name of a module that exports a typed view (a subclass of <code>View</code>). The module name must use the same syntax as for <code>sap.ui.define/sap.ui.require</code> (slash-separated name without '.js' suffix).\n\n<b>Example:</b> Instantiating a typed view with <code>View.create</code> <pre>\n  View.create({\n    viewName: \"module:myapp/views/MainView\"\n  }).then(oView) {\n    oView.placeAt(\"content\");\n  });\n</pre>\n\nA typed view can also be instantiated by calling its constructor without any arguments: <pre>\n  sap.ui.require([\"myapp/views/MainView\"], function(MainView) {\n    new MainView().placeAt(\"content\");\n  });\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Other Methods</h3> Besides <code>createContent</code>, there are two other methods that a view can implement: Method {@link #getControllerName getControllerName} defines the name of the controller that should be instantiated and used for the view. The name must be in class name notation (dot notation), without the <code>\".controller\"</code> suffix. The suffix will be added by the framework when loading the module containing the controller.\n\n{@link #getAutoPrefixId getAutoPrefixId} defines whether the IDs of controls created during the execution of <code>createContent</code> will be prefixed with the ID of the view automatically. The default implementation of this method returns <code>false</code>.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","specialSettings":[{"name":"controller","type":"sap.ui.core.mvc.Controller","visibility":"public","description":"Controller instance to use for this view."},{"name":"controllerName","type":"string","visibility":"public","description":"Name of the controller class to use for this view.

E.g. the <code>RichTextEditor</code> with running TinyMCE uses this method to be able to focus the popups of the TinyMCE if the <code>RichTextEditor</code> runs within a <code>Popup</code>/<code>Dialog</code> etc.\n\n<strong>Since 1.75</strong>, DOM elements which have the attribute <code>data-sap-ui-integration-popup-content</code> are considered to be part of all opened popups. Those DOM elements can get the focus without causing the autoclose popup to be closed or the modal popup to take the focus back to itself. Additionally, a further DOM query selector can be provided by using {@link sap.ui.core.Popup.addExternalContent} to make the DOM elements which match the selector be considered as part of all opened popups. Please be aware that the Popup implementation only checks if a DOM element is marked with the attribute <code>data-sap-ui-integration-popup-content</code>. The actual attribute value is not checked. To prevent a DOM element from matching, you must remove the attribute itself. Setting the attribute to a falsy value is not enough in this case.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"object","associations":[{"name":"childPopups","singularName":"childPopup","type":"sap.ui.core.Popup","cardinality":"0..n","visibility":"hidden","methods":["getChildPopups","addChildPopup","removeChildPopup","removeAllChildPopups"]}],"events":[{"name":"opened","visibility":"public","methods":["attachOpened","detachOpened","fireOpened"]},{"name":"closed","visibility":"public","methods":["attachClosed","detachClosed","fireClosed"]}]},"constructor":{"visibility":"public","parameters":[{"name":"oContent","type":"sap.ui.core.Control|sap.ui.core.Element|Element","optional":false,"description":"the content to render in the popup.

In both variants, the returned renderer inherits all properties (methods, fields) from the given parent renderer. Both variants also add an 'extend' method to the created renderer that behaves like the modern signature variant of this <code>Renderer.extend</code> method, but allows to extend the new renderer instead of <code>sap.ui.core.Renderer</code>.\n\n<h3>Modern Signature</h3>\n\nIn the modern signature variant, two parameters must be given: a qualified name for the new renderer (its global name, in dot-notation), and an optional object literal that contains methods or fields to be added to the new renderer class.\n\nThis signature has been designed to resemble the class extension mechanism as provided by {@link sap.ui.base.Object.extend Object.extend}.\n\n<pre>\nsap.ui.define(['sap/ui/core/Renderer'],\n    function(Renderer) {\n    \"use strict\";\n\n    var LabelRenderer = Renderer.extend('sap.m.LabelRenderer', {\n        render: function(oRM, oControl) {\n\n            renderPreamble(oRM, oControl);\n\n            // implementation core renderer logic here\n\n            renderPostamble(oRM, oControl);\n\n        },\n\n        renderPreamble : function(oRM, oControl) {\n        ...\n        },\n\n        renderPostamble : function(oRM, oControl) {\n        ...\n        }\n\n    });\n\n    return LabelRenderer;\n});\n</pre>\n\nThe extension of renderers works across multiple levels. A <code>FancyLabelRenderer</code> can extend the above <code>LabelRenderer</code>:\n\n<pre>\nsap.ui.define(['sap/m/LabelRenderer'],\n    function(LabelRenderer) {\n    \"use strict\";\n\n    var FancyLabelRenderer = LabelRenderer.extend('sap.mylib.FancyLabelRenderer', {\n        render: function(oRM, oControl) {\n\n            // call base renderer\n            LabelRenderer.renderPreamble(oRM, oControl);\n\n            // ... do your own fancy rendering here\n\n            // call base renderer again\n            LabelRenderer.renderPostamble(oRM, oControl);\n        }\n    });\n\n    return FancyLabelRenderer;\n});\n</pre>\n\n<b>Note:</b> The modern signature no longer requires the <code>bExport</code> flag to be set for the enclosing {@link sap.ui.define} call. The Renderer base class takes care of the necessary global export of the renderer. This allows non-SAP developers to write a renderer that complies with the documented restriction for <code>sap.ui.define</code> (no use of bExport = true outside sap.ui.core projects).\n\n<h3>Deprecated Signature</h3>\n\nThe deprecated old signature expects just one parameter: a renderer that should be extended. With that signature, the renderer can't be exported globally as the name of the renderer class is not known.\n\nFor compatibility reasons, the class created by the deprecated signature contains a property <code>_super</code> that references the parent class. It shouldn't be used by applications / control developers as it doesn't work reliably for deeper inheritance chains: if the old variant of <code>Renderer.extend</code> is used on two or more levels of the inheritance hierarchy, the <code>_super</code> property of the resulting renderer class will always point to the implementation of the base renderer of the last call to extend. Instead of using <code>this._super</code>, renderer implementations should use the new signature variant and access the base implementation of a method via the AMD reference to the base renderer (as shown in the FancyLabelRenderer example above).\n\n<h3>Use as a Generic Method</h3>\n\nOnly renderers that have been created with a call to <code>extend</code> will get their own <code>extend</code> method to create new subclasses. To allow extending from older renderers that have been written from scratch as a plain object, the <code>Renderer.extend</code> method can be called as a <i>generic method</i>, providing the base renderer as <code>this</code>.\n\nExample: Derive from <code>HBoxRenderer</code> (which is assumed to be a plain object) <pre>\nsap.ui.define(['sap/ui/core/Renderer', 'sap/m/HBoxRenderer'],\n    function(Renderer, HBoxRenderer) {\n    \"use strict\";\n\n    // Call 'extend' as a generic method, providing the HBoxRenderer as 'this'\n    var MyRenderer = Renderer.extend.call(HBoxRenderer, 'sap.m.LabelRenderer', {\n\n        someOverriddenHook: function(oRM, oControl) {\n        ...\n        },\n\n    });\n\n    return LabelRenderer;\n});\n</pre>\n\n<b>Note:</b> The deprecated signature cannot be used generically, it is only supported when called on <code>sap.ui.core.Renderer</code>."},{"name":"getTextAlign","visibility":"protected","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"string","description":"the actual text alignment that must be set for this environment"},"parameters":[{"name":"oTextAlign","type":"sap.ui.core.TextAlign","optional":false,"description":"the text alignment of the Control"},{"name":"oTextDirection","type":"sap.ui.core.TextDirection","optional":false,"description":"the text direction of the Control"}],"description":"Returns the TextAlignment for the provided configuration."}]},{"kind":"class","name":"sap.ui.core.RenderManager","basename":"RenderManager","resource":"sap/ui/core/RenderManager.js","module":"sap/ui/core/RenderManager","export":"","static":true,"visibility":"public","extends":"Object","description":"A class that handles the rendering of controls.\n\nFor the default rendering task of UI5, a shared RenderManager is created and owned by <code>sap.ui.core.Core</code>. Controls or other code that want to render controls outside the default rendering task can create a private instance of RenderManager by calling the {@link sap.ui.core.Core#createRenderManager sap.ui.getCore().createRenderManager()} method. When such a private instance is no longer needed, it should be {@link #destroy destroyed}.\n\nControl renderers only have access to a subset of the public and protected instance methods of this class. The instance methods {@link #flush}, {@link #render} and {@link #destroy} are not part of that subset and are reserved to the owner of the corresponding RenderManager instance. Renderers will use the provided methods to create their HTML output. The RenderManager will collect the HTML output and inject the final HTML DOM at the desired location.\n\n<h3>Renderers</h3> When the {@link #renderControl} method of the RenderManager is invoked, it will retrieve the default renderer for that control. By convention, the default renderer is implemented in its own namespace (static class) which matches the name of the control's class with the additional suffix 'Renderer'. So for a control <code>sap.m.Input</code> the default renderer will be searched for under the global name <code>sap.m.Input<i>Renderer</i></code>.\n\n<h3>Semantic Rendering</h3> As of 1.67, <code>RenderManager</code> provides a set of new APIs to describe the structure of the DOM that can be used by the control renderers.\n\n<pre>\n\n  myButtonRenderer.render = function(rm, oButton) {\n\n      rm.openStart(\"button\", oButton);\n      rm.attr(\"tabindex\", 1);\n      rm.class(\"myButton\");\n      rm.style(\"width\", oButton.getWidth());\n      rm.openEnd();\n          rm.text(oButton.getText());\n      rm.close(\"button\");\n\n  };\n\n</pre>\n\nBy default, when the control is invalidated (e.g. a property is changed, an aggregation is removed, or an association is added), it will be registered for rerendering. During the (re)rendering, the <code>render</code> method of the control renderer is executed via a specified <code>RenderManager</code> interface and the control instance.\n\nTraditional string-based rendering creates a new HTML structure of the control in every rendering cycle and removes the existing control DOM structure from the DOM tree.\n\nThe set of new semantic <code>RenderManager</code> APIs lets us understand the structure of the DOM, walk along the live DOM tree, and figure out changes as new APIs are called. If there is a change, then <code>RenderManager</code> patches only the required parts of the live DOM tree. This allows control developers to remove their DOM-related custom setters.\n\n<b>Note:</b> To enable the new in-place rendering technology, the <code>apiVersion</code> property of the control renderer must be set to <code>2</code>. This property is not inherited by subclass renderers. It has to be set anew by each subclass to assure that the extended contract between framework and renderer is fulfilled (see next paragraph).\n\n<pre>\n\n  var myButtonRenderer = {\n      apiVersion: 2    // enable semantic rendering\n  };\n\n  myButtonRenderer.render = function(rm, oButton) {\n\n      rm.openStart(\"button\", oButton);\n      ...\n      ...\n      rm.close(\"button\");\n\n  };\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Contract for Renderer.apiVersion 2</h3> To allow a more efficient in-place DOM patching and to ensure the compatibility of the control, the following prerequisites must be fulfilled for the controls using the new rendering technology:\n\n<ul> <li>Legacy control renderers must be migrated to the new semantic renderer API: {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#openStart openStart}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#voidStart voidStart}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#style style}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#class class}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#attr attr}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#openEnd openEnd}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#voidEnd voidEnd}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#text text}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#unsafeHtml unsafeHtml}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#icon icon}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#accessibilityState accessibilityState}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#renderControl renderControl}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#cleanupControlWithoutRendering cleanupControlWithoutRendering} </li> <li>During the migration, restrictions that are defined in the API documentation of those methods must be taken into account, e.g. tag and attribute names must be set in their canonical form.</li> <li>Fault tolerance of HTML5 markup is not applicable for the new semantic rendering API, e.g. except void tags, all tags must be closed; duplicate attributes within one HTML element must not exist.</li> <li>Existing control DOM structure will not be removed from the DOM tree; therefore all custom events, including the ones that are registered with jQuery, must be de-registered correctly at the <code>onBeforeRendering</code> and <code>exit</code> hooks.</li> <li>Classes and attribute names must not be escaped.</li> <li>Styles should be validated via types (e.g. <code>sap.ui.core.CSSSize</code>). But this might not be sufficient in all cases, e.g. validated URL values can contain harmful content; in this case {@link module:sap/base/security/encodeCSS encodeCSS} can be used.</li> <li>To allow a more efficient DOM update, second parameter of the {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#openStart openStart} or {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#voidStart voidStart} methods must be used to identify elements, e.g. use <code>rm.openStart(\"div\", oControl.getId() + \"-suffix\");</code> instead of <code>rm.openStart(\"div\").attr(\"id\", oControl.getId() + \"-suffix\");</code></li> <li>Controls that listen to the <code>focusin</code> event must double check their focus handling. Since DOM nodes are not removed and only reused, the <code>focusin</code> event might not be fired during rerendering.</li> </ul>\n\n<h3>Contract for Renderer.apiVersion 4</h3> The <code>apiVersion 4</code> marker of the control renderer lets the <code>RenderManager</code> know if a control's output is not affected by changes in the parent control. By default, if a property, an aggregation, or an association of a control is changed, then the control gets invalidated, and the rerendering process for that control and all of its children starts. That means child controls rerender together with their parent even though there is no DOM update necessary. If a control's output is only affected by its own properties, aggregations, or associations, then the <code>apiVersion 4</code> marker can help to reuse the control's DOM output and prevent child controls from rerendering unnecessarily while they are getting rendered by their parent. This can help to improve performance by reducing the number of re-renderings.<br> For example: A control called \"ParentControl\" has a child control called \"ChildControl\". ChildControl has its own properties, aggregations, and associations, and its output is only affected by them. The <code>apiVersion 4</code> marker is set in the renderer of ChildControl. Whenever a property of the ParentControl is changed during the re-rendering process, the <code>RenderManager</code> will check the <code>apiVersion</code> marker of the ChildControl's renderer, and if it's 4, the <code>RenderManager</code> will skip rendering of the ChildControl.<br>\n\nTo allow a more efficient rerendering with an <code>apiVersion 4</code> marker, the following prerequisites must be fulfilled for the control to ensure compatibility:\n\n<ul> <li>All the prerequisites of the <code>apiVersion 2</code> marker must be fulfilled by the control.</li> <li>The behavior and rendering logic of the control must not rely on the assumption that it will always be re-rendered at the same time as its parent.</li> <li>The <code>onBeforeRendering</code> and <code>onAfterRendering</code> hooks of the control must not be used to manipulate or access any elements outside of the control's own DOM structure.</li> <li>The control renderer must maintain a proper rendering encapsulation and render only the properties, aggregations, and associations that are specific to the control. The renderer should not reference or depend on any state of the parent control or any other external element.</li> <li>If certain aggregations are dependent on the state of the parent control, they must always be rendered together with their parent. To accomplish this, the parent control must use the {@link sap.ui.core.Control#invalidate invalidate} method to signal to the child controls that they need to re-render whenever the dependent state of the parent control changes. This guarantees that the child controls are always in sync with the parent control, regardless of the <code>apiVersion</code> definition of their renderer.</li> </ul><br>\n\n<b>Note:</b> The rendering can only be skipped if the renderer of each descendant control has the <code>apiVersion 4</code> marker, and no <code>onBeforeRendering</code> or <code>onAfterRendering</code> event delegates are registered. However, while {@link sap.ui.core.Element#addEventDelegate adding the event delegate}, setting the <code>canSkipRendering</code> property to <code>true</code> on the event delegate object can be done to indicate that those delegate handlers are compliant with the <code>apiVersion:4</code> prerequisites and still allows for rendering optimization.<br> The <code>canSkipRendering</code> property can also be used for the controls that enhance the accessibility state of child controls with implementing the {@link sap.ui.core.Element#enhanceAccessibilityState enhanceAccessibilityState} method. In this case, setting the <code>canSkipRendering</code> property to <code>true</code> lets the <code>RenderManager</code> know that the parent control's accessibility enhancement is static and does not interfere with the child control's rendering optimization.","methods":[{"name":"accessibilityState","visibility":"public","returnValue":{"type":"this","description":"Reference to <code>this</code> in order to allow method chaining"},"parameters":[{"name":"oElement","type":"sap.ui.core.Element","optional":true,"omissible":true,"description":"The <code>Element</code> whose accessibility state should be rendered"},{"name":"mProps","type":"object","optional":true,"description":"A map of additional properties that should be added or changed."}],"description":"Collects accessibility related attributes for an <code>Element</code> and renders them as part of the currently rendered DOM element.\n\nSee the WAI-ARIA specification for a general description of the accessibility related attributes.

Control developers have to check whether it fulfills their requirements. In case of problems (for example the <code>RadioButton</code> has a <code>selected</code> property but must provide an <code>aria-checked</code> attribute) the auto-generated result of this function can be influenced via the parameter <code>mProps</code> as described below.\n\nThe parameter <code>mProps</code> can be used to either provide additional attributes which should be rendered and/or to avoid the automatic generation of single ARIA attributes. The 'aria-' prefix will be prepended automatically to the keys (Exception: Attribute <code>role</code> does not get the prefix 'aria-').\n\nExamples:<br> <code>{hidden : true}</code> results in <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> independent of the presence or absence of the visibility property.<br> <code>{hidden : null}</code> ensures that no <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute is written independent of the presence or absence of the visibility property.<br>\n\nThe function behaves in the same way for the associations <code>ariaDescribedBy</code> and <code>ariaLabelledBy</code>. To append additional values to the auto-generated <code>aria-describedby</code> and <code>aria-labelledby</code> attributes, the following format can be used: <pre>\n  {describedby : {value: \"id1 id2\", append: true}} =>  aria-describedby = \"ida idb id1 id2\"\n</pre> (assuming that \"ida idb\" is the auto-generated part based on the association <code>ariaDescribedBy</code>)."},{"name":"addClass","visibility":"public","returnValue":{"type":"this","description":"Reference to <code>this</code> in order to allow method chaining"},"parameters":[{"name":"sName","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"name of the class to be added; null values are ignored"}],"description":"Adds a class to the class collection if the name is not empty or null.

But in some cases it makes sense that a control only renders a subset of its children based on some criterion. For example, a typical carousel control might, for performance reasons, only render the currently visible children (and maybe some child before and after the visible area to facilitate slide-in / slide-out animations), but not all children. This leads to situations where a child had been rendered before, but shouldn't be rendered anymore after an update of the carousel's position. The DOM related state of that child then must be cleaned up correctly, e.g. by de-registering resize handlers or native event handlers. <code>cleanupControlWithoutRendering</code> helps with that task by triggering the same activities that the normal rendering triggers before the rendering of a control (e.g. it fires the <code>BeforeRendering</code> event). It just doesn't call the renderer and the control will not receive an <code>AfterRendering</code> event.\n\nThe following example shows how <code>renderControl</code> and <code>cleanupControlWithoutRendering</code> should be used:\n\n<pre>\n  CarouselRenderer.render = function(rm, oCarousel){\n\n    ...\n\n    oCarousel.getPages().forEach( function( oPage ) {\n       if ( oCarousel.isPageToBeRendered( oPage ) ) {\n          rm.renderControl( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering, render, later onAfterRendering\n       } else {\n          rm.cleanupControlWithoutRendering( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering\n       }\n    });\n\n    ...\n\n  };\n</pre>\n\n<h3>DOM Removal</h3> The method does not remove the DOM of the given control. The caller of this method has to take care to remove it at some later point in time. It should indeed be <i>later</i>, not <i>before</i> as the <code>onBeforeRendering</code> hook of the control might need access to the old DOM for a proper cleanup.\n\nFor parents which are rendered with the normal mechanism as shown in the example above, the removal of the old child DOM is guaranteed. The whole DOM of the parent control (including the DOM of the no longer rendered child) will be replaced with new DOM (no longer containing the child) when the rendering cycle finishes.\n\n<b>Note:</b>: the functionality of this method is different from the default handling for invisible controls (controls with <code>visible == false</code>). The standard rendering for invisible controls still renders a placeholder DOM. This allows rerendering of the invisible control once it becomes visible again without a need to render its parent, too. Children that are cleaned up with this method here, are supposed to have no more DOM at all. Rendering them later on therefore requires an involvement (typically: a rendering) of their parent."},{"name":"close","visibility":"public","since":"1.67","returnValue":{"type":"this","description":"Reference to <code>this</code> in order to allow method chaining"},"parameters":[{"name":"sTagName","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Tag name of the HTML element"}],"description":"Closes an open tag started with <code>openStart</code> and ended with <code>openEnd</code>.\n\nThis indicates that there are no more children to append to the open tag."},{"name":"createInvisiblePlaceholderId","visibility":"protected","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"string","description":"The ID used for the invisible Placeholder of this element"},"parameters":[{"name":"oElement","type":"sap.ui.core.Element","optional":false,"description":"The Element instance for which to create the placeholder ID"}],"description":"Creates the ID to be used for the invisible Placeholder DOM element.

It's a perfect candidate to lazy load something inside of it. <br/> <b>Example app structure:</b><br/> We have a rootView that is returned by the createContent function of our UIComponent. This view contains an sap.m.App control with the ID 'myApp' <pre>\n<code>\n&lt;View xmlns=\"sap.m\"&gt;\n    &lt;App id=\"myApp\"/&gt;\n&lt;/View&gt;\n</code>\n</pre> an xml view called 'Detail' <pre>\n<code>\n&lt;View xmlns=\"sap.m\"&gt;\n    &lt;IconTabBar&gt;\n        &lt;items&gt;\n            &lt;IconTabFilter&gt;\n                &lt;!-- content of our first tab --&gt;\n            &lt;IconTabFilter&gt;\n            &lt;IconTabFilter id=\"mySecondTab\"&gt;\n                &lt;!-- nothing here, since we will lazy load this one with a target --&gt;\n            &lt;IconTabFilter&gt;\n        &lt;/items&gt;\n    &lt;/IconTabBar&gt;\n&lt;/View&gt;\n</code>\n</pre> and a view called 'SecondTabContent', this one contains our content we want to have lazy loaded.

This is the <b>only asynchronous</b> API variant. This variant is the preferred way to retrieve theming parameters. The structure of the return value is the same as listed above depending on the type of the name property within the <code>object</code>.</li> </ul> </p>\n\n<p>The returned key-value maps are a copy so changing values in the map does not have any effect</p>\n\n<p> Please see the examples below for a detailed guide on how to use the <b>asynchronous variant</b> of the API. </p>","examples":[{"caption":"Scenario 1: Parameters are already available","text":" // \"sapUiParam1\", \"sapUiParam2\", \"sapUiParam3\" are already available\n Parameters.get({\n    name: [\"sapUiParam1\", \"sapUiParam2\", \"sapUiParam3\"],\n    callback: function(mParams) {\n       // callback is not called, since all Parameters are available synchronously\n    }\n });\n // As described above, returns a map with key-value pairs corresponding to the parameters:\n // mParams = {sapUiParam1: '...value...', sapUiParam2: '...value...', sapUiParam3: '...value...'}"},{"caption":"Scenario 2: Some Parameters are missing ","text":" // \"sapUiParam1\", \"sapUiParam2\" are already available\n // \"sapUiParam3\" is not yet available\n Parameters.get({\n    name: [\"sapUiParam1\", \"sapUiParam2\", \"sapUiParam3\"],\n    callback: function(mParams) {\n       // Parameters.get() callback gets the same map with key-value pairs as in \"Scenario 1\".\n       // mParams = {sapUiParam1: '...value...', sapUiParam2: '...value...', sapUiParam3: '...value...'}\n    }\n });\n // return-value is undefined, since not all Parameters are yet available synchronously"},{"caption":"Scenario 3: Default values","text":" // Scenario 1 (all parameters are available): the returned parameter map can be used to merge with a map of default values.\n // Scenario 2 (one or more parameters are missing): the returned undefined value does not change the default parameters\n // This allows you to always retrieve a consistent set of parameters, either synchronously via the return-value or asynchronously via the provided callback.\n var mMyParams = Object.assign({\n    sapUiParam1: \"1rem\",\n    sapUiParam2: \"#FF0000\",\n    sapUiParam3: \"16px\"\n }, Parameters.get({\n    name: [\"sapUiParam1\", \"sapUiParam2\", \"sapUiParam3\"],\n    callback: function(mParams) {\n       // merge the current parameters with the actual parameters in case they are retrieved asynchronously\n       Object.assign(mMyParams, mParams);\n    }\n });"}]},{"name":"getActiveScopesFor","visibility":"restricted","allowedFor":["sap.viz"],"static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"string[][]","description":"Two dimensional array with scopes in bottom up order"},"parameters":[{"name":"oElement","type":"object","optional":false,"description":"element/control instance"},{"name":"bAsync","type":"boolean","optional":false,"description":"Whether the scope should be retrieved asynchronous"}],"description":"Returns the active scope(s) for a given control by looking up the hierarchy.\n\nThe lookup navigates the DOM hierarchy if it's available.

Controls get rendered only when they are directly or indirectly contained in the <code>content</code> aggregation of a <code>UIArea</code>. <code>Control#placeAt</code> ensures that there is a <code>UIArea</code> with the given ID and adds the control to the <code>content</code> aggregation of this <code>UIArea</code>. Whenever controls become invalidated, the corresponding <code>UIArea</code> remembers this and takes care of the re-rendering of the control.\n\nAdditionally, <code>UIArea</code>s play an important role in the event handling of controls. They register for a standard set of browser events. For each incoming event, they identify the control to which the target of the event belongs to and dispatch the event to that control. This dispatching reduces the number of event handlers in a page.\n\n<code>UIArea</code>s also act as a data binding root for their contained controls. Whenever a model is attached to or detached from the Core, this change is propagated to all <code>UIAreas</code> which in turn propagate it further down to their aggregated children, etc.\n\nThe special aggregation named <code>dependents</code> also participates in the databinding, but its content is not rendered by the <code>UIArea</code>.

When implementing this interface the loading and processing of an asynchronous <code>rootView</code> will be chained into the result Promise of the {@link sap.ui.core.Component.create Component.create} factory. An additional async flag can be omitted. See Sample 1 below.\n\nSamples 2 and 3 show how subclasses can overwrite the <code>createContent</code> function to run asynchronously. To create the root control asynchronously, the subclass has to define the <code>sap.ui.core.IAsyncContentCreation</code> interface in the metadata.","examples":[{"caption":"Sample 1: Asynchronous Root View Creation","text":"sap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/core/UIComponent\", \"sap/ui/core/Fragment\"], function(UIComponent, Fragment) {\n    return UIComponent.extend(\"my.sample\", {\n        metadata: {\n            rootView: {\n                viewName: \"my.sample.views.Main\",\n                type: \"XML\",\n                id: \"sampleMainView\"\n            },\n            interfaces: [\"sap.ui.core.IAsyncContentCreation\"]\n        }\n    });\n});"},{"caption":"Sample 2: Asynchronous createContent() - XMLView","text":"sap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/core/UIComponent\", \"sap/ui/core/mvc/XMLView\"], function(UIComponent, XMLView) {\n    return UIComponent.extend(\"my.sample\", {\n        metadata: {\n            // ...\n            interfaces: [\"sap.ui.core.IAsyncContentCreation\"]\n        },\n        createContent: function() {\n            // Dynamically create a root view\n            return XMLView.create({ ... });\n        }\n    });\n});"},{"caption":"Sample 3: Asynchronous createContent() - Fragment","text":"sap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/core/UIComponent\", \"sap/ui/core/Fragment\"], function(UIComponent, Fragment) {\n    return UIComponent.extend(\"my.sample\", {\n        metadata: {\n            // ...\n            interfaces: [\"sap.ui.core.IAsyncContentCreation\"]\n        },\n        createContent: function() {\n            // In this use case, a Fragment must only have one single root control.\n            // The root control can contain several controls in turn.\n            return Fragment.load({ ... });\n        }\n    });\n});"}]},{"name":"createId","visibility":"public","returnValue":{"type":"string","description":"prefixed id"},"parameters":[{"name":"sId","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Component local ID of the element"}],"description":"Convert the given component local element ID to a globally unique ID by prefixing it with the component ID."},{"name":"extend","visibility":"public","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"function","description":"The created class / constructor function"},"parameters":[{"name":"sClassName","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Qualified name of the newly created class"},{"name":"oClassInfo","type":"object","optional":true,"parameterProperties":{"metadata":{"name":"metadata","type":"sap.ui.core.Component.MetadataOptions","optional":true,"parameterProperties":{"routing":{"name":"routing","type":"sap.ui.core.UIComponent.RoutingMetadata","optional":true,"description":"Since 1.16.

The formatter function needs to be marked with a property <code>requiresIContext = true</code> to express that it requires this extended signature (compared to ordinary formatter functions). The usual arguments are provided after the first one (currently: the raw value from the model).\n\nThis interface provides callback functions to access the model and path which are needed to process OData V4 annotations.

In this case <code>foo</code> is called with arguments <code>oInterface, vRawValue</code> such that <code>oInterface.getModel().getObject(oInterface.getPath()) === vRawValue</code> holds. <pre>\nwindow.foo = function (oInterface, vRawValue) {\n    //TODO ...\n};\nwindow.foo.requiresIContext = true;\n</pre>\n\n<b>Composite Binding Examples:</b> Suppose you have the same formatter function and it is used in a composite binding like <code>&lt;Text text=\"{path: 'Label', formatter: 'foo'}: {path: 'Value', formatter: 'foo'}\"/></code>. In this case <code>oInterface.getPath()</code> refers to \".../Label\" in the 1st call and \".../Value\" in the 2nd call. This means each formatter call knows which part of the composite binding it belongs to and behaves just as if it was an ordinary binding.\n\nSuppose your formatter is not used within a part of the composite binding, but at the root of the composite binding in order to aggregate all parts like <code> &lt;Text text=\"{parts: [{path: 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}], formatter: 'foo'}\"/></code>. In this case <code>oInterface.getPath(0)</code> refers to \".../Label\" and <code>oInterface.getPath(1)</code> refers to \".../Value\". This means, the root formatter can access the ith part of the composite binding at will (since 1.31.0); see also {@link #.getInterface getInterface}. The function <code>foo</code> is called with arguments such that <code> oInterface.getModel(i).getObject(oInterface.getPath(i)) === arguments[i + 1]</code> holds.\n\nTo distinguish those two use cases, just check whether <code>oInterface.getModel() === undefined</code>, in which case the formatter is called on root level of a composite binding. To find out the number of parts, probe for the smallest non-negative integer where <code>oInterface.getModel(i) === undefined</code>. This additional functionality is, of course, not available from {@link sap.ui.model.Context}, i.e. such formatters MUST be called with an instance of this context interface.","methods":[{"name":"getInterface","visibility":"public","static":true,"since":"1.31.0","returnValue":{"type":"sap.ui.core.util.XMLPreprocessor.IContext","description":"the context interface related to the indicated part"},"parameters":[{"name":"iPart","type":"number","optional":true,"omissible":true,"description":"index of part in case of the root formatter of a composite binding"},{"name":"sPath","type":"string","optional":true,"description":"a path, interpreted relative to <code>this.getPath(iPart)</code>"}],"throws":[{"type":"Error","description":"In case an index is given but the current interface does not belong to the root formatter of a composite binding, or in case the given index is invalid (e.g. missing or out of range), or in case a path is missing because no index is given, or in case a path is given but the model cannot not create a binding context synchronously"}],"description":"Returns a context interface for the indicated part in case of the root formatter of a composite binding.

controls that use a XML fragment representation for their visual parts. From a user perspective such controls appear as any other control, but internally the rendering part is added as a fragment. The fragment that is used should appear in the same folder as the control's JS implementation with the file extension <code>.control.xml</code>. The fragment's content can access the interface data from the XMLComposite control via bindings. Currently only aggregations and properties can be used with bindings inside a fragment. The exposed model that is used for internal bindings in the fragment has the default name <code>$this</code>. The name will always start with an <code>$</code>. The metadata of the derived control can define the alias with its metadata. A code example can be found below.\n\nAs XMLComposites compose other controls, they are only invalidated and re-rendered if explicitly defined. Additional metadata for invalidation can be given for properties and aggregation. The default invalidation is <code>\"none\"</code>. Setting invalidate to <code>true</code> for properties and aggregations sets the complete XMLComposite to invalidate and rerender.</code>\n\nExample: <pre>\nXMLComposite.extend(\"sap.mylib.MyXMLComposite\", {\n  metadata : {\n    library: \"sap.mylib\",\n    properties : {\n      text: { //changing this property will not re-render the XMLComposite\n         type: \"string\",\n         defaultValue: \"\"\n      },\n      title: { //changing this property will re-render the XMLComposite as it defines invalidate: true\n         type: \"string\",\n         defaultValue: \"\",\n         invalidate: true\n      },\n      value: { //changing this property will re-render the XMLComposite as it defines invalidate: true\n         type: \"string\",\n         defaultValue: \"\",\n         invalidate: true\n      }\n    },\n    defaultProperty : \"text\",\n    aggregations : {\n      items : {\n         type: \"sap.ui.core.Control\",\n         invalidate: true\n      },\n      header : {\n         type: \"sap.mylib.FancyHeader\",\n         multiple : false\n      }\n    },\n    defaultAggregation : \"items\"\n    events: {\n      outerEvent : {\n        parameters : {\n          opener : \"sap.ui.core.Control\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  //alias defaults to \"this\"\n  alias: \"mycontrolroot\" //inner bindings will use model name $mycontrolroot\n  //fragment defaults to {control name}.control.xml in this case sap.mylib.MyXMLComposite.control.xml\n  fragment: \"sap.mylib.MyXMLCompositeOther.control.xml\" //the name of the fragment\n});\n</pre>\n\nInternally the XMLComposite instantiates and initializes the given fragment and stores the resulting control in a hidden aggregation named <code>_content</code>. The fragment should only include one root element.\n\nBindings of inner controls to the interface of the XMLComposite can be done with normal binding syntax. Here properties are used as property bindings and aggregations are used as list bindings. Currently it is not possible to bind associations in a fragment.\n\nExample: <pre>\n   &lt;core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m=\"sap.m\" xmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\"&gt;\n      &lt;m:Text text=\"{$this&gt;text}\" visible=\"{= ${$this&gt;text} !== \"\"}\" /&gt;\n   &lt;/core:FragmentDefinition&gt;\n</pre> <pre>\n   &lt;core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m=\"sap.m\" xmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\"&gt;\n      &lt;m:VBox items=\"{path:\"$this&gt;texts\", filters:{path:\"text\", operator:\"Contains\", value1:\"Text\"}, sorter:{path:\"text\", descending:true}}\"&gt;\n          &lt;m:Text text=\"{$this&gt;text}\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/m:VBox&gt;\n   &lt;/core:FragmentDefinition&gt;\n</pre> <pre>\n   &lt;core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m=\"sap.m\" xmlns:core=\"sap.ui.core\"&gt;\n      &lt;m:Button text=\"Press Me\" press=\"handlePress\"/&gt;\n   &lt;/core:FragmentDefinition&gt;\n</pre>\n\nAll events handled within the fragment will be dispatched to the XMLComposite control. It is recommended to follow this paradigm to allow reuse of a XMLComposite without any dependency to controller code of the current embedding view.\n\n<pre>\n   MyXMLComposite.prototype.handlePress = function() {\n       this.fireOuterEvent(); // passing on the event to the outer view\n   }\n</pre>\n\n<b>Note:</b> {@link topic:b11d853a8e784db6b2d210ef57b0f7d7 Requiring modules in XML} will result in side effects that might cause the XMLComposite to not work properly. We suggest you require the needed modules inside the JavaScript coding of the class extending the XMLComposite.\n\nAccepts an object literal <code>mSettings</code> that defines initial property values, aggregated and associated objects as well as event handlers.

It uses the existing {@link sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetadata} as a foundation and merges V4 annotations from the existing {@link sap.ui.model.odata.ODataAnnotations} directly into the corresponding model element.\n\nThis model is not prepared to be inherited from.\n\nAlso, annotations from the \"http://www.sap.com/Protocols/SAPData\" namespace are lifted up from the <code>extensions</code> array and transformed from objects into simple properties with an \"sap:\" prefix for their name. Note that this happens in addition, thus the following example shows both representations. This way, such annotations can be addressed via a simple relative path instead of searching an array. <pre>\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\" : \"BusinessPartnerID\",\n\t\t\t\"extensions\" : [{\n\t\t\t\t\"name\" : \"label\",\n\t\t\t\t\"value\" : \"Bus.

ID\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n</pre> <b>Note:</b> Annotation terms are not merged, but replaced as a whole (\"PUT\" semantics). That means, if you have, for example, an OData V2 annotation <code>sap:sortable=false</code> at a property <code>PropA</code>, the corresponding OData V4 annotation is added to each entity set to which this property belongs: <pre>\n\t\t\"Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.SortRestrictions\": {\n\t\t\t\"NonSortableProperties\" : [\n\t\t\t\t{\"PropertyPath\" : \"BusinessPartnerID\"}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n</pre> If the same term <code>\"Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.SortRestrictions\"</code> targeting one of these entity sets is also contained in an annotation file, the complete OData V4 annotation converted from the OData V2 annotation is replaced by the one contained in the annotation file for the specified target. Converted annotations never use a qualifier and are only overwritten by the same annotation term without a qualifier.\n\nThis model is read-only and thus only supports {@link sap.ui.model.BindingMode.OneTime OneTime} binding mode. No events ({@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:parseError parseError}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestCompleted requestCompleted}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestFailed requestFailed}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestSent requestSent}) are fired!\n\nWithin the meta model, the objects are arranged in arrays. <code>/dataServices/schema</code>, for example, is an array of schemas where each schema has an <code>entityType</code> property with an array of entity types, and so on. So, <code>/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/16</code> can be the path to the entity type with name \"Order\" in the schema with namespace \"MySchema\". However, these paths are not stable: If an entity type with lower index is removed from the schema, the path to <code>Order</code> changes to <code>/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/15</code>.\n\nTo avoid problems with changing indexes, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#getObject getObject} and {@link sap.ui.model.Model#getProperty getProperty} support XPath-like queries for the indexes (since 1.29.1). Each index can be replaced by a query in square brackets. You can, for example, address the schema using the path <code>/dataServices/schema/[${namespace}==='MySchema']</code> or the entity using <code>/dataServices/schema/[${namespace}==='MySchema']/entityType/[${name}==='Order']</code>.\n\nThe syntax inside the square brackets is the same as in expression binding. The query is executed for each object in the array until the result is true (truthy) for the first time. This object is then chosen.\n\n<b>BEWARE:</b> Access to this OData meta model will fail before the promise returned by {@link #loaded loaded} has been resolved!","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"object"},"constructor":{"visibility":"public","parameters":[{"name":"oMetadata","type":"sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetadata","optional":false,"description":"the OData model's metadata object"},{"name":"oAnnotations","type":"sap.ui.model.odata.ODataAnnotations","optional":true,"description":"the OData model's annotations object"},{"name":"oDataModel","type":"sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel","optional":false,"description":"the data model instance"}],"description":"DO NOT CALL this private constructor for a new <code>ODataMetaModel</code>, but rather use {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#getMetaModel getMetaModel} instead!"},"methods":[{"name":"extend","visibility":"public","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"function","description":"Created class / constructor function"},"parameters":[{"name":"sClassName","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Name of the class being created"},{"name":"oClassInfo","type":"object","optional":true,"description":"Object literal with information about the class"},{"name":"FNMetaImpl","type":"function","optional":true,"description":"Constructor function for the metadata object;

Additionally, they support validating a given value against the type's constraints.\n\nThe following target types may be supported: <table> <tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr> <tr><td><code>string</code></td><td>The value is converted to a <code>string</code>, so that it can be displayed in an input field. Supported by all types.</td></tr> <tr><td><code>boolean</code></td><td>The value is converted to a <code>Boolean</code>, so that it can be displayed in a checkbox. Only supported by {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Boolean}.</td></tr> <tr><td><code>int</code></td><td>The value is converted to an integer (as <code>number</code>). May cause truncation of decimals and overruns. Supported by all numeric types.</td></tr> <tr><td><code>float</code></td><td>The value is converted to a <code>number</code>. Supported by all numeric types.</td></tr> <tr><td><code>object</code></td><td>The value is converted to a <code>Date</code> so that it can be displayed in a date or time picker. Supported by {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Date}, {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTime} and {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeOffset} since 1.69.0. </td></tr> <tr><td><code>any</code></td><td>A technical format. The value is simply passed through. Only supported by <code>format</code>, not by <code>parse</code>. Supported by all types.</td></tr> </table>\n\nAll constraints relevant for OData V2 may be given as strings besides their natural types (e.g. <code>nullable : \"false\"</code> or <code>maxLength : \"10\"</code>). This makes the life of template processors easier, but is not needed for OData V4.\n\n<b>Handling of <code>null</code></b>:\n\nAll types handle <code>null</code> in the same way. When formatting to <code>string</code>, it is simply passed through (and <code>undefined</code> becomes <code>null</code>, too). When parsing from <code>string</code>, it is also passed through. Additionally, {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.String String} and {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Guid Guid} convert the empty string to <code>null</code> when parsing. <code>validate</code> decides based on the constraint <code>nullable</code>: If <code>false</code>, <code>null</code> is not accepted and leads to a (locale-dependent) <code>ParseException</code>.\n\nThis ensures that the user cannot clear an input field bound to an attribute with non-nullable type. However, it does not ensure that the user really entered something if the field was empty before.\n\n<b><code>Date</code> vs. <code>DateTime</code></b>:\n\nThe type {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Date} is only valid for an OData V4 service. Displaying data is possible if you use the type for an OData V2 service, but you will receive an error message from the server once you try to save any changes.\n\nFor an OData V2 service use {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTime} with the constraint <code>displayFormat: \"Date\"</code> to display only a date."},{"kind":"class","name":"sap.ui.model.odata.type.Boolean","basename":"Boolean","resource":"sap/ui/model/odata/type/Boolean.js","module":"sap/ui/model/odata/type/Boolean","export":"","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"1.27.0","extends":"sap.ui.model.odata.type.ODataType","description":"This class represents the OData primitive type <a href=\"http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/overview#AbstractTypeSystem\"> <code>Edm.Boolean</code></a>.\n\nIn both {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel} and {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel} this type is represented as a <code>boolean</code>.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"object"},"constructor":{"visibility":"public","parameters":[{"name":"oFormatOptions","type":"object","optional":true,"description":"format options as defined in the interface of {@link sap.ui.model.SimpleType}; this type ignores them since it does not support any format options"},{"name":"oConstraints","type":"object","optional":true,"parameterProperties":{"nullable":{"name":"nullable","type":"boolean|string","optional":true,"defaultValue":true,"description":"if <code>true</code>, the value <code>null</code> is accepted"}},"description":"constraints; {@link #validateValue validateValue} throws an error if any constraint is violated"}],"description":"Constructor for an OData primitive type <code>Edm.Boolean</code>."},"methods":[{"name":"extend","visibility":"public","static":true,"returnValue":{"type":"function","description":"Created class / constructor function"},"parameters":[{"name":"sClassName","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Name of the class being created"},{"name":"oClassInfo","type":"object","optional":true,"description":"Object literal with information about the class"},{"name":"FNMetaImpl","type":"function","optional":true,"description":"Constructor function for the metadata object; if not given, it defaults to the metadata implementation used by this class"}],"description":"Creates a new subclass of class sap.ui.model.odata.type.Boolean with name <code>sClassName</code> and enriches it with the information contained in <code>oClassInfo</code>.\n\n<code>oClassInfo</code> might contain the same kind of information as described in {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.ODataType.extend}."},{"name":"formatValue","visibility":"public","returnValue":{"type":"boolean|string","description":"the formatted output value in the target type; <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code> are formatted to <code>null</code>"},"parameters":[{"name":"bValue","type":"boolean","optional":false,"description":"the value to be formatted"},{"name":"sTargetType","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"the target type; may be \"any\", \"boolean\", \"string\", or a type with one of these types as its {@link sap.ui.base.DataType#getPrimitiveType primitive type}.

Be aware that this applies only to filters which do not prevent the creation of a hierarchy. So filtering on a property (e.g. a \"Customer\") is fine, as long as the application ensures that the responses from the back end are sufficient to create a valid hierarchy on the client. Subsequent paging requests for sibling and child nodes must also return responses, since the filters are sent with every request. Using control-defined filters (see {@link sap.ui.model.FilterType.Control}) via the {@link #filter} function is not supported for the operation mode <code>Server</code>.\n\n<h4>OperationMode.Client and OperationMode.Auto</h4> The ODataTreeBinding supports control-defined filters only in operation modes <code>Client</code> and <code>Auto</code>.

The \"parseKeepsEmptyString\" format option is set. </ul> Since 1.78.0, both \"edm:Path\" and \"edm:PropertyPath\" are also supported if <code>vRawValue</code> is the path itself, and not the object wrapping it. </ul>\n\n<h3>$AnnotationPath and $Path</h3> If <code>oDetails.context.getPath()</code> contains a single \"$AnnotationPath\" or \"$Path\" segment, the value corresponding to that segment is considered as a data binding path prefix whenever a dynamic \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\" or \"14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath\" is turned into a data binding. Use {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.resolve$Path} to avoid these prefixes in cases where they are not applicable.\n\n<h4>$AnnotationPath</h4> Example for \"$AnnotationPath\" in the context's path: <pre>\n&lt;Annotations Target=\"com.sap.gateway.default.iwbep.tea_busi.v0001.EQUIPMENT\">\n  &lt;Annotation Term=\"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Facets\">\n    &lt;Collection>\n      &lt;Record Type=\"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.ReferenceFacet\">\n        &lt;PropertyValue Property=\"Target\" AnnotationPath=\"EQUIPMENT_2_PRODUCT/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.QuickInfo\" />\n      &lt;/Record>\n    &lt;/Collection>\n  &lt;/Annotation>\n&lt;/Annotations>\n&lt;Annotations Target=\"com.sap.gateway.default.iwbep.tea_busi_product.v0001.Product\">\n  &lt;Annotation Term=\"com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.QuickInfo\" Path=\"Name\" />\n&lt;/Annotations>\n</pre> <pre>\n&lt;Text text=\"{meta>/Equipments/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Facets/0/Target/$AnnotationPath/@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}\" />\n</pre> <code>format</code> returns a binding with path \"EQUIPMENT_2_PRODUCT/Name\".\n\n<h4>$Path</h4> Example for \"$Path\" in the context's path: <pre>\n&lt;Annotations Target=\"com.sap.gateway.default.iwbep.tea_busi.v0001.EQUIPMENT\">\n  &lt;Annotation Term=\"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem\">\n    &lt;Collection>\n      &lt;Record Type=\"com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DataField\">\n        &lt;PropertyValue Property=\"Value\" Path=\"EQUIPMENT_2_PRODUCT/Name\" />\n      &lt;/Record>\n    &lt;/Collection>\n  &lt;/Annotation>\n&lt;/Annotations>\n&lt;Annotations Target=\"com.sap.gateway.default.iwbep.tea_busi_product.v0001.Product/Name\">\n  &lt;Annotation Term=\"com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.QuickInfo\" Path=\"PRODUCT_2_SUPPLIER/Supplier_Name\" />\n&lt;/Annotations>\n</pre> <pre>\n&lt;Text text=\"{meta>/Equipments/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.QuickInfo@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}\" />\n</pre> <code>format</code> returns a binding with path \"EQUIPMENT_2_PRODUCT/PRODUCT_2_SUPPLIER/Supplier_Name\".\n\n<h3>Annotations on an Operation or a Parameter</h3> Since 1.71.0, for annotations on an operation or a parameter, the binding parameter's name is stripped off any dynamic \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\" and \"14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath\" where it might be used as a first segment. Since 1.76.0 this does not apply to annotations on a parameter. In the former case, we assume that the resulting data binding is relative to the parent context of the operation binding, that is, to the context representing the binding parameter itself. In the latter case, we assume that the resulting data binding is relative to the parameter context of the operation binding (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#getParameterContext}).\n\nExample: <pre>\n   &lt;Action Name=\"ShipProduct\" EntitySetPath=\"_it\" IsBound=\"true\" >\n       &lt;Parameter Name=\"_it\" Type=\"name.space.Product\" Nullable=\"false\"/>\n       &lt;Parameter Name=\"City\" Type=\"Edm.String\"/>\n   &lt;/Action>\n</pre> For the operation <code>ShipProduct</code> mentioned above, the following annotation targets an operation parameter and refers back to the binding parameter. <pre>\n    &lt;Annotations Target=\"name.space.ShipProduct(name.space.Product)/City\">\n       &lt;Annotation Term=\"com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text\" Path=\"_it/SupplierIdentifier\"/>\n    &lt;/Annotations>\n</pre>\n\nUsing <code>AnnotationHelper.format</code> like <pre>\n&lt;Text text=\"{meta>/Products/name.space.ShipProduct/$Parameter/City@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}\" />\n</pre> results in <pre>\n&lt;Text text=\"{path:'_it/SupplierIdentifier',type:'sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int32'}\" />\n</pre> and the data binding evaluates to the <code>SupplierIdentifier</code> property of the entity the operation is called on.\n\n<h3>Operation Parameters</h3> Since 1.73.0, this function can be used on action or function parameters and results in a relative data binding, just like a \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\".\n\nAssume we have the following metadata for an unbound action \"AcChangeTeamBudgetByID\": <pre>\n   &lt;Action Name=\"AcChangeTeamBudgetByID\">\n       &lt;Parameter Name=\"TeamID\" Type=\"Edm.String\" Nullable=\"false\" MaxLength=\"10\"/>\n       &lt;Parameter Name=\"Budget\" Type=\"Edm.Decimal\" Nullable=\"false\" Precision=\"16\" Scale=\"variable\"/>\n   &lt;/Action>\n</pre>\n\nLet <code>ChangeTeamBudgetByID</code> be the action import of this action. Using <code>AnnotationHelper.format</code> for the <code>TeamID</code> like <pre>\n&lt;Text text=\"{meta>/ChangeTeamBudgetByID/TeamID@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}\" />\n</pre> results in <pre>\n&lt;Text text=\"{path:'TeamID',type:'sap.ui.model.odata.type.String',constraints:{'maxLength':10,'nullable':false},formatOptions:{'parseKeepsEmptyString':true}}\" />\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Binding Parameters and Format Options</h3> Since 1.77.0, binding parameters and format options can be given. The usage <pre>\n&lt;Input value=\"{meta>/ChangeTeamBudgetByID/Budget@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format($($$noPatch : true$), $(groupingEnabled : false$))}\" />\n</pre> results in a data binding with the given binding parameters and format options. Note how, for an object notation, curly brackets must be replaced by <code>$(</code> and <code>$)</code> respectively. Use <code>null</code>, not <code>undefined</code>, in case no binding parameters are needed.\n\n<h3>Structural Properties</h3> Since 1.78.0, this function can be used on a structural property and results in a relative data binding, just like a \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\". The usage <pre>\n&lt;Input value=\"{meta>/Department/Name@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}\"/>\n</pre> results in <pre>\n&lt; Input value=\"{path:'Name',type:'sap.ui.model.odata.type.String',constraints:{'maxLength':40,'nullable':false},formatOptions:{'parseKeepsEmptyString':true}}\"/>\n</pre>","references":["sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.resolve$Path","sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.value"]},{"name":"getNavigationBinding","visibility":"public","static":true,"since":"1.43.0","returnValue":{"type":"string","description":"A data binding according to the result of {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.getNavigationPath}, for example \"{ToSupplier}\" or \"\""},"parameters":[{"name":"sPath","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"The path value from the meta model, for example \"ToSupplier/@com.sap.vocabularies.Communication.v1.Address\" or \"@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.FieldGroup#Dimensions\""}],"throws":[{"type":"Error","description":"If the result of {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.getNavigationPath} contains segments which are not valid OData identifiers and violate the data binding syntax"}],"description":"Returns a data binding according to the result of {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.getNavigationPath}."},{"name":"getNavigationPath","visibility":"public","static":true,"since":"1.43.0","returnValue":{"type":"string","description":"The path of structural and navigation properties, for example \"ToSupplier\" or \"\""},"parameters":[{"name":"sPath","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"The path value from the meta model, for example \"ToSupplier/@com.sap.vocabularies.Communication.v1.Address\" or \"@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.FieldGroup#Dimensions\""}],"description":"A function that helps to interpret OData V4 annotations.

An event handler can only be attached to this binding for the following events: 'AggregatedDataStateChange', 'change', 'dataReceived', 'dataRequested', 'DataStateChange', 'patchCompleted', and 'patchSent'. For other events, an error is thrown.\n\nA context binding can also be used as an <i>operation binding</i> to support bound actions, action imports, bound functions and function imports. If you want to control the execution time of an operation, for example a function import named \"GetNumberOfAvailableItems\", create a context binding for the path \"/GetNumberOfAvailableItems(...)\" (as specified here, including the three dots). Such an operation binding is <i>deferred</i>, meaning that it does not request automatically, but only when you call {@link #execute}. {@link #refresh} is always ignored for actions and action imports. For bound functions and function imports, it is ignored if {@link #execute} has not yet been called. Afterwards it results in another call of the function with the parameter values of the last execute.\n\nThe binding parameter for bound actions or bound functions may be given in the binding path, for example \"/SalesOrderList('42')/name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm\". This can be used if the exact entity for the binding parameter is known in advance. If you use a relative binding instead, the operation path is a concatenation of the parent context's canonical path and the deferred binding's path.\n\n<b>Example</b>: You have a table with a list binding to \"/SalesOrderList\". In each row you have a button to confirm the sales order, with the relative binding \"name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm(...)\". Then the parent context for such a button refers to an entity in \"SalesOrderList\", so its canonical path is \"/SalesOrderList('<i>SalesOrderID</i>')\" and the resulting path for the action is \"/SalesOrderList('<i>SalesOrderID</i>')/name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm\".\n\nThis also works if the relative path of the deferred operation binding starts with a navigation property. Then this navigation property will be part of the operation's resource path, which is still valid.\n\nA deferred operation binding is not allowed to have another deferred operation binding as parent.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"object"},"events":[{"name":"change","visibility":"public","since":"1.37.0","parameters":[{"name":"oEvent","type":"sap.ui.base.Event","parameterProperties":{"getParameters":{"name":"getParameters","type":"function() : Object<any>","optional":false,"parameterProperties":{"reason":{"name":"reason","type":"sap.ui.model.ChangeReason","optional":false,"description":"The reason for the 'change' event could be <ul> <li> {@link sap.ui.model.ChangeReason.Change Change} when the binding is initialized, when an operation has been processed (see {@link #execute}), or in {@link #resume} when the binding has been modified while suspended, <li> {@link sap.ui.model.ChangeReason.Refresh Refresh} when the binding is refreshed, <li> {@link sap.ui.model.ChangeReason.Context Context} when the parent context is changed, <li> {@link sap.ui.model.ChangeReason.Remove Remove} when the element context has been deleted (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#delete}). </ul>"}},"description":"Function which returns an object containing all event parameters"}},"description":"The event object"}],"description":"The 'change' event is fired when the binding is initialized or its parent context is changed.

If the binding's update group ID has {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.API}, it is repeated with the next call of {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#submitBatch}. Otherwise it is repeated with the next update for the entity. Since 1.67.0, {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#submitBatch} can also be used for group IDs with {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.Auto} in order to repeat the creation even if there is no update for the entity.\n\nEach time the data for the created entity is sent to the server, a {@link #event:createSent 'createSent'} event is fired and each time the client receives a response for the creation, a {@link #event:createCompleted 'createCompleted'} event is fired, independent of whether the creation was successful or not.\n\nThe initial data for the created entity can be supplied via the parameter <code>oInitialData</code> and modified via property bindings. Properties that are not part of the initial data show the default value from the service metadata on the UI, but they are not sent to the server. If there is no default value, <code>null</code> is used instead, even if the property is not <code>Nullable</code>. The initial data may contain instance annotations.\n\nNote: If a server requires a property in the request, you must supply this property in the initial data, for example if the server requires a unit for an amount. This also applies if this property has a default value.\n\nNote: After creation, the created entity is refreshed to ensure that the data specified in this list binding's $expand is available. This refresh is done via the group ID of the binding, unless the group ID has {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.API}, in which case '$auto' is used. To skip this refresh, set <code>bSkipRefresh</code> to <code>true</code>. To avoid errors you must skip this refresh when using {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects} in the same $batch to refresh the complete collection containing the newly created entity.\n\nSince 1.115.0 it is possible to create nested entities in a collection-valued navigation property together with the entity (so-called \"deep create\"), for example a list of items for an order. For this purpose, bind the list relative to a transient context. Calling this method then adds a transient entity to the parent's navigation property, which is sent with the payload of the parent entity. Such a nested context cannot be inactive.\n\n<b>Note:</b> After a succesful creation of the main entity the context returned for a nested entity is no longer valid. Do not use the {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#created created} promise of such a context! New contexts are created for the nested collection because it is not possible to reliably assign the response entities to those of the request, especially if the count differs. For this reason, the <code>created</code> promises of all nested contexts are always rejected with an instance of <code>Error</code>, even if the deep create succeeds. This error always has the property <code>canceled</code> with the value <code>true</code>.\n\nSince 1.118.0 deep create also supports single-valued navigation properties; no API call is required in this case. Simply bind properties of the related entity relative to a transient context. An update to the property adds it to the POST request of the parent entity, and by this the create becomes deep.\n\nDeep create requires the <code>autoExpandSelect</code> parameter at the {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#constructor model}. The refresh after a deep create is optimized. Only the (navigation) properties missing from the POST response are actually requested. If the POST response contains all required properties, no request is sent at all.\n\nNote: Creating at the end is only allowed if the final length of the binding is known (see {@link #isLengthFinal}), so that there is a clear position to place this entity at. This is the case if the complete collection has been read or if the system query option <code>$count</code> is <code>true</code> and the binding has processed at least one request.\n\nCreating a new child beneath an existing and visible parent node (which must either be a leaf or expanded, but not collapsed) is supported (@experimental as of version 1.117.0) in case of a recursive hierarchy (see {@link #setAggregation}). The parent node must be identified via an {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context} instance given as <code>oInitialData[\"@$ui5.node.parent\"]</code> (which is immediately removed from the new child's data). It can be <code>null</code> or absent when creating a new root node (@experimental as of version 1.120.0). <code>bSkipRefresh</code> must be set, but both <code>bAtEnd</code> and <code>bInactive</code> must not be set. No other creation or {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#move move} must be pending, and no other modification (including collapse of some ancestor node) must happen while this creation is pending!"},{"name":"destroy","visibility":"public","since":"1.40.1","description":"Destroys the object.

An invalid path leads to an <code>undefined</code> result and a warning is logged. Use {@link #getObject} for synchronous access.\n\nA relative path is appended to the context's path separated by a forward slash(\"/\"). A relative path starting with \"@\" (that is, an annotation) is appended without a separator. Use \"./\" as a prefix for such a relative path to enforce a separator.\n\nExample: <pre>\n&lt;template:with path=\"/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE\" var=\"property\">\n  &lt;!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE/$Type -->\n  \"{property>$Type}\"\n\n  &lt;!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text -->\n  \"{property>@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text}\"\n\n  &lt;!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text -->\n  \"{property>./@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text}\"\n&lt;/template:with>\n</pre>\n\nThe basic idea is that every path described in <a href= \"https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part3-csdl.html#_Attribute_Target\" >\"14.2.1 Attribute Target\"</a> in specification \"OData Version 4.0 Part 3: Common Schema Definition Language\" is a valid absolute path within the metadata model if a leading slash is added; for example \"/\" + \"MySchema.MyEntityContainer/MyEntitySet/MyComplexProperty/MyNavigationProperty\". Also, every path described in \"14.5.2 Expression edm:AnnotationPath\", \"14.5.11 Expression edm:NavigationPropertyPath\", \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\", and \"14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath\" is a valid relative path within the metadata model if a suitable prefix is added which addresses an entity container, entity set, singleton, complex type, entity type, or property; for example \"/MySchema.MyEntityType/MyProperty\" + \"@vCard.Address#work/FullName\".\n\nThe absolute path is split into segments and followed step-by-step, starting at the global scope of all known qualified OData names. There are two technical properties there: \"$Version\" (typically \"4.0\") and \"$EntityContainer\" with the name of the single entity container for this metadata model's service.\n\nAn empty segment in between is invalid, except to force return type lookup for operation overloads (see below). An empty segment at the end caused by a trailing slash differentiates between a name and the object it refers to. This way, \"/$EntityContainer\" refers to the name of the single entity container and \"/$EntityContainer/\" refers to the single entity container as an object.\n\nThe segment \"@sapui.name\" refers back to the last OData name (simple identifier or qualified name) or annotation name encountered during path traversal immediately before \"@sapui.name\": <ul> <li> \"/EMPLOYEES@sapui.name\" results in \"EMPLOYEES\" and \"/EMPLOYEES/@sapui.name\" results in the same as \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type\", that is, the qualified name of the entity set's type (see below how \"$Type\" is inserted implicitly). Note how the separating slash again makes a difference here. <li> \"/EMPLOYEES/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label@sapui.name\" results in \"@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label\" and a slash does not make any difference as long as the annotation does not have a \"$Type\" property. <li> A technical property (that is, a numerical segment or one starting with a \"$\") immediately before \"@sapui.name\" is invalid, for example \"/$EntityContainer@sapui.name\". </ul> The path must not continue after \"@sapui.name\".\n\nIf the current object is a string value, that string value is treated as a relative path and followed step-by-step before the next segment is processed. Except for this, a path must not continue if it comes across a non-object value. Such a string value can be a qualified name (example path \"/$EntityContainer/...\"), a simple identifier (example path \"/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/...\") including the special name \"$ReturnType\" (since 1.71.0), or even a path according to \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\" etc. (example path \"/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/...\".\n\nSegments starting with an \"@\" character, for example \"@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label\", address annotations at the current object. As the first segment, they refer to the single entity container. For objects which can only be annotated inline (see \"14.3 Element edm:Annotation\" minus \"14.2.1 Attribute Target\"), the object already contains the annotations as a property. For objects which can (only or also) be annotated via external targeting, the object does not contain any annotation as a property. Such annotations MUST be accessed via a path. Such objects include operations (that is, actions and functions) and their parameters, which can be annotated for a single overload or for all overloads at the same time.\n\nSegments starting with an OData name followed by an \"@\" character, for example \"/TEAMS@Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.TopSupported\", address annotations at an entity set, singleton, or property, not at the corresponding type. In contrast, \"/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Deletable\" (note the separating slash) addresses an annotation at the entity set's type. This is in line with the special rule of \"14.5.12 Expression edm:Path\" regarding annotations at a navigation property itself.\n\n\"@\" can be used as a segment to address a map of all annotations of the current object. This is useful for iteration, for example via <code>&lt;template:repeat list=\"{entityType>@}\" ...></code>.\n\nAnnotations of an annotation are addressed not by two separate segments, but by a single segment like \"@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.TextArrangement\". Each annotation can have a qualifier, for example \"@first#foo@second#bar\". Note: If the first annotation's value is a record, a separate segment addresses an annotation of that record, not an annotation of the first annotation itself. In a similar way, annotations of \"7.2 Element edm:ReferentialConstraint\", \"7.3 Element edm:OnDelete\", \"10.2 Element edm:Member\" and \"14.5.14.2 Element edm:PropertyValue\" are addressed by segments like \"&lt;7.2.1 Attribute Property>@...\", \"$OnDelete@...\", \"&lt;10.2.1 Attribute Name>@...\" and \"&lt;14.5.14.2.1 Attribute Property>@...\" (where angle brackets denote a variable part and sections refer to specification <a href= \"https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part3-csdl.htm\" >\"OData Version 4.0 Part 3: Common Schema Definition Language\"</a>).\n\nAnnotations starting with \"@@\", for example \"@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.isMultiple\" or \"@@.AH.isMultiple\" or \"@@.isMultiple\", represent computed annotations. Their name without the \"@@\" prefix must refer to a function in <code>mParameters.scope</code> in case of a relative name starting with a dot, which is stripped before lookup; see the <code>&lt;template:alias></code> instruction for XML Templating. In case of an absolute name, it is searched in <code>mParameters.scope</code> first and then in the global namespace. The names \"requestCurrencyCodes\" and \"requestUnitsOfMeasure\" default to {@link #requestCurrencyCodes} and {@link #requestUnitsOfMeasure} resp. if not present in <code>mParameters.scope</code>. This function is called with the current object (or primitive value) and additional details and returns the result of this {@link #requestObject} call. The additional details are given as an object with the following properties: <ul> <li> <code>{boolean} $$valueAsPromise</code> Whether the computed annotation may return a <code>Promise</code> resolving with its value (since 1.57.0) <li> <code>{@link sap.ui.model.Context} context</code> Points to the current object <li> <code>{object} overload</code> In case of annotations of an operation or a parameter, if filtering by binding parameter determines a single operation overload, that overload is passed (since 1.71.0), else <code>undefined</code> <li> <code>{string} schemaChildName</code> The qualified name of the schema child where the computed annotation has been found </ul> Computed annotations cannot be iterated by \"@\". The path must not continue after a computed annotation. Since 1.77.0, arguments can be given to a computed annotation much like a JavaScript function call. The left parenthesis must immediately follow the name and no whitespace must follow the right parenthesis. In between, a comma separated list of JSON values may be given (see <code>JSON.parse</code>); string literals may be enclosed in single or double quotes; property names in object literals need not be quoted; curly brackets must be replaced by <code>$(</code> and <code>$)</code> respectively, no matter where they appear, and there is no escaping for <code>$(</code> and <code>$)</code> to prevent replacement back to curly brackets before parsing; as usual, <code>null</code> is supported while <code>undefined</code> is not. Example: \"@@AH.format($(style : 'short'$)))\" or \"@@AH.format(null, $($$noPatch : true$)))\".\n\nA segment which represents an OData qualified name is looked up in the global scope (\"scope lookup\") and thus determines a schema child which is used later on. Unknown qualified names are invalid. This way, \"/acme.DefaultContainer/EMPLOYEES\" addresses the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the schema child named \"acme.DefaultContainer\". This also works indirectly (\"/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES\") and implicitly (\"/EMPLOYEES\", see below).\n\nA segment which represents an OData simple identifier (or the special names \"$ReturnType\", since 1.71.0, or \"$Parameter\", since 1.73.0) needs special preparations. The same applies to the empty segment after a trailing slash. <ol> <li> If the current object has a \"$Action\", \"$Function\" or \"$Type\" property, it is used for scope lookup first. This way, \"/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE\" addresses the same object as \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type/ENTRYDATE\", namely the \"ENTRYDATE\" child of the entity type corresponding to the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the entity container. The other cases jump from an operation import to the corresponding operation overloads. <li> Else if the segment is the first one within its path, the last schema child addressed via scope lookup is used instead of the current object. This can only happen indirectly as in \"/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/...\" where the schema child is the entity container and the navigation property binding can contain the simple identifier of another entity set within the same container.\n\nIf the segment is the first one overall, \"$EntityContainer\" is inserted into the path implicitly. In other words, the entity container is used as the initial schema child. This way, \"/EMPLOYEES\" addresses the same object as \"/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES\", namely the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the entity container. <li> Afterwards, if the current object is an array, it represents overloads for an operation. Annotations of an operation (since 1.71.0) or a parameter (since 1.66.0) can be immediately addressed, no matter if they apply for a single overload or for all overloads at the same time, for example \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction@\" or \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/Team_ID@\". Annotations of an unbound operation overload can be addressed like \"/OperationImport/@$ui5.overload@\", while \"/OperationImport/@\" addresses annotations of the operation import itself. The special name \"$ReturnType\" can be used (since 1.71.0) like a parameter to address annotations of the return type instead, for example \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType@\".\n\nOperation overloads are then filtered by binding parameter; multiple overloads after filtering are invalid except if addressing all overloads via the segment \"@$ui5.overload\", for example \"/acme.NewAction/@$ui5.overload\".\n\nOnce a single overload has been determined, its parameters can be immediately addressed, for example \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/Team_ID\", or the special name \"$Parameter\" can be used (since 1.73.0), for example \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$Parameter/Team_ID\". The special name \"$ReturnType\" can be used (since 1.71.0) like a parameter to address the return type instead, for example \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType\". For all other names, the overload's \"$ReturnType/$Type\" is used for scope lookup. This way, \"/GetOldestWorker/AGE\" addresses the same object as \"/GetOldestWorker/$ReturnType/AGE\" or \"/GetOldestWorker/$Function/0/$ReturnType/$Type/AGE\", and \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/MemberCount\" (assuming \"MemberCount\" is not a parameter in this example) addresses the same object as \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType/MemberCount\" or \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType/$Type/MemberCount\". In case a name can refer both to a parameter and to a property of the return type, an empty segment can be used instead of \"@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType/$Type\" or \"$ReturnType\" to force return type lookup, for example \"/TEAMS/acme.NewAction//Team_ID\".\n\nFor primitive return types, the special segment \"value\" can be used to refer to the return type itself (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute}). This way, \"/GetOldestAge/value\" addresses the same object as \"/GetOldestAge/$ReturnType\" or \"/GetOldestAge/$Function/0/$ReturnType\" or \"/GetOldestAge/@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType\" (which is needed for automatic type determination, see {@link #requestUI5Type}). </ol>\n\nA trailing slash can be used to continue a path and thus force scope lookup or OData simple identifier preparations, but then stay at the current object. This way, \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type/\" addresses the entity type itself corresponding to the \"EMPLOYEES\" child of the entity container. Although the empty segment is not an OData simple identifier, it can be used as a placeholder for one. In this way, \"/EMPLOYEES/\" addresses the same entity type as \"/EMPLOYEES/$Type/\". That entity type in turn is a map of all its OData children (that is, structural and navigation properties) and determines the set of possible child names that might be used after the trailing slash.\n\n\"$\" can be used as the last segment to continue a path and thus force scope lookup, but no OData simple identifier preparations. In this way, it serves as a placeholder for a technical property. The path must not continue after \"$\", except for a computed annotation. Example: \"/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/$\" addresses the referenced property itself, not the corresponding type like \"/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/\" does. \"/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Target/$NavigationPropertyPath/$@@.isMultiple\" calls a computed annotation on the navigation property itself, not on the corresponding type.\n\nAny other segment, including an OData simple identifier, is looked up as a property of the current object. Segments which themselves represent a path, such as the keys for the \"$ReferentialConstraint\" and \"$NavigationPropertyBinding\" maps, need to use URL encoding for the slash character (\"%2F\"), for example \"/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/Address%2FCountries/...\".","references":["#getObject"]},{"name":"requestUI5Type","visibility":"public","since":"1.37.0","returnValue":{"type":"Promise<sap.ui.model.odata.type.ODataType>","description":"A promise that gets resolved with the corresponding UI5 type from {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type}; if no specific type can be determined, a warning is logged and {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Raw} is used"},"parameters":[{"name":"sPath","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"An absolute path to an OData property within the OData data model"},{"name":"mFormatOptions","type":"object","optional":true,"description":"Type-specific format options, since 1.81.0.

Since 1.53 it can also be a plain object. When autoWait is true, the waitFor statement will not execute success callbacks as long as there is pending asynchronous work such as for example: open XMLHTTPRequests (requests to a server), scheduled delayed work and promises, unfinished UI navigation. In addition, the control state will be checked with the {@link sap.ui.test.matchers.Interactable} matcher, and the control will have to be enabled. So when autoWait is enabled, success behaves like an action in terms of waiting. It is recommended to set this value to true for all your waitFor statements using: <pre>\n    Opa5.extendConfig({\n        autoWait: true\n    });\n</pre> Why it is recommended: When writing a huge set of tests and executing them frequently you might face tests that are sometimes successful but sometimes they are not. Setting the autoWait to true should stabilize most of those tests. The default \"false\" could not be changed since it causes existing tests to fail. There are cases where you do not want to wait for controls to be \"Interactable\": For example when you are testing the Busy indication of your UI during the sending of a request. But these cases are the exception so it is better to explicitly adding autoWait: false to this waitFor. <pre>\n    this.waitFor({\n        id: \"myButton\",\n        autoWait: false,\n        success: function (oButton) {\n             Opa5.assert.ok(oButton.getBusy(), \"My Button was busy\");\n        }\n    });\n</pre> This is also the easiest way of migrating existing tests.

Could be a function, a single matcher instance, an array of matcher instances, or, since version 1.72, a plain object to specify matchers declaratively. For a full list of built-in matchers, see {@link sap.ui.test.matchers}.\n\nMatchers are applied to each control found by the <code>waitFor</code> function. The matchers are a pipeline: the first matcher gets a control as an input parameter, each subsequent matcher gets the same input as the previous one, if the previous output is <code>true</code>.\n\nIf the previous output is a truthy value, the next matcher will receive this value as an input parameter. If there is a matcher that does not match a control (for example, returns a falsy value), then the control is filtered out.\n\nCheck function is only called if the matchers matched at least one control, for example, it is not called if matchers filter out all controls/values. Check and success are be called with all matching controls as an input parameter. A matcher inline function has one parameter - an array of controls, and returns an array of the filtered controls.\n\nA matcher instance could extend <code>sap.ui.test.matchers.Matcher</code> and must have a method with name <code>isMatching</code>, that accepts an array of controls and returns an array of the filtered controls.\n\nA declarative matcher object is a set of key-value pairs created by the object literal notation, such that: <ul> <li>Every key is a name of an OPA5 built-in matcher, starting with a lower case letter. The following example declares an <code>sap.ui.test.matchers.Properties</code> matcher: <pre><code>            matchers: {\n                properties: {<...>}\n            }\n</code></pre> </li> <li>Every value is an object or an array or objects. Each object represents the properties that will be fed to one instance of the declared matcher.

Here is one of the most common usages: <code> function (sButtonId) { // executes a Press on a button with a specific id new Opa5().waitFor({ id: sButtonId, actions: new Press() }); }; </code> But actions will only be executed once and only after the check function returned true. Before actions are executed the {@link sap.ui.test.matchers.Interactable} matcher and the internal autoWait logic will check if the Control is currently able to perform actions if it is not, Opa5 will try again after the 'pollingInterval'. That means actions will only be executed if: <ul> <li> Controls and their parents are visible, not busy and not hidden behind a blocking layer </li> <li> The controls are not hidden behind static elements such as dialogs </li> <li> There is no pending asynchronous work performed by the application </li> </ul> If there are multiple controls in Opa5's result set the action will be executed on all of them. The actions will be invoked directly before success is called. In the documentation of the success parameter there is a list of conditions that have to be fulfilled. They also apply for the actions. There are some predefined actions in the {@link sap.ui.test.actions} namespace. since 1.42 an Action may add other waitFors. The next action or the success handler will not be executed until the waitFor of the action has finished.
