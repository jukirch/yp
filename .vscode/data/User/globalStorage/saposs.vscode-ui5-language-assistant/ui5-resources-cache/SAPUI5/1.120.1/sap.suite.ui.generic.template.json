Kept here to avoid conflicts (in the very unlikely case, Fiori elements would come up with the idea to invent a new extension method with the exact same name some day in future, and any application would still have an implementation for this old extension).\n\n(Original purpose: When (standard) filters (i.e. filters defined in annotations) are provided with default values (also from the annotation), and the user actively removed the default without giving a new value, and later tried to restore from that state, the default values were reappearing. This was caused by the way the old API of SFB (getDataSuiteFormat and setDataSuiteFormat) worked: the get method returned only select options for the filters that actually had values (i.e. no select option for the filters the user removed the values from), and the set method only overrode those values, select options were provided for (i.e. the missing ones just kept their default value set during initialization). To overcome this problem, the extension was created to inform Fiori elements about all fields potentially running into that problem, and we added a select option (I EQ \"\") for those fields. This workaround of course ahs two severe problems: A filter with eq \"\" is not the same as not having a filter for the same field (rather the opposite), and all applications were required to keep extension and annotations in sync (and missing to do that would only be found in very exceptional cases). With the newer API of SFB (getUiState and setUiState), this problem has been overcome (esp. as setUiState overrides all filters, not only the ones provided).)"}],"methods":[{"name":"adaptNavigationParameterExtension","visibility":"protected","static":true,"parameters":[{"name":"oSelectionVariant","type":"sap.fe.navigation.SelectionVariant","optional":false,"description":"Selection variant object containing the information which needs to be passed to the target application"},{"name":"oObjectInfo","type":"object","optional":false,"parameterProperties":{"semanticObject":{"name":"semanticObject","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Semantic object used for the intend based navigation"},"action":{"name":"action","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Action on the context for which the navigation is triggered"}},"description":"Context object based on which the intent based navigation is triggered"}],"description":"This method is called by SAP Fiori elements before triggering an external navigation.
